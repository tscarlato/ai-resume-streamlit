The CDC has issued guidelines on how to cover these events that reduce the likelihood of them spreading. Basically, don't glorify the killer (even in suicide), don't over simplify the motives, don't give how to level details of the event, don't play the event on loop (move on to the aftermath rather than being stuck on the same images and scenes), don't present the event as a means to an end, and don't focus on the positive aspects of the killer (even in suicide). This is one of the reasons that suicide is vastly under reported.  The media botched this hard after Robin Williams and the country experienced a 10% spike in suicides in the wake thereof.

That might sound close but it wasn't. The Dutch only had one shot on goal. The US had 15. This is the soccer equivalent of an NFL defense never letting the opponent cross the 50. The USWNT is probably the best team in the history of the sport. There have been 8 women's world cups and the US has won 4, lost one on penalty kicks, and has never placed lower than third. The USWNT is America at it's best and we should all be immensely proud of the athletes. But how did America get so damn good at women's soccer?\n\nThe answer is a still controversial law called Title IX which mandates that all schools that receive federal funding not discriminate in opportunity on the basis of sex including sports and athletic scholarships. Only 700 girls were playing soccer in the US in 1972 when it passed the first time (it was later gutted by the supreme court, passed again by congress, vetoed by Reagan, and overridden by congress in 1988) . Now we're the global powerhouse in women's soccer. At the last Winter Olympics the US women won more medals than the US men. Serena Williams might be the most dominant individual athlete in any sport ever. In just 2 generations US Womens Athletics has become globally dominant.  \n\nNot only should every American be proud of our Women's National Team but also take note that when we invest in girls like we do in boys those girls grow into women of immeasurable talent. Sure, it's embarrassing that we had to pass a law to give girls the same opportunities we gave boys, but we should be proud that our society eventually got over our own bias and gave girls a chance. It's a powerful thing for a culture to be able to change for the better.  I see this USWNT as living proof that American can change for the better. It  may take three acts of congress, over riding a presidential veto, and two generations but America can be better. \n\nAlso, Title IX wasn't just for sports. When it passed only 13% of doctorate degrees were awarded to women. in 2018 it was 51%. Today, we're celebrating the athletes of the US Women's National Team but we should remember women are achieving in every facet of society not just the playing field.

I don't think anything in life brought Ian as much joy or pride as his family. (Obviously, this is an impossible time for them.)\n\nIan was 38. He would have been 39 next month. \n\nThe cause of death has not yet been officially determined but last year Ian had a seizure, was rushed to the hospital, and had a brain tumor removed. It seems reasonable to assume that Ians death is related to the surgery or medication or something related.  When we all got to the hospital after Ians brain surgery he was still pretty out of it. His wife told us that when he came to and was unable to speak (he was intubated) the first thing he wrote on a paper was \"Am I a hostage?\". Ian was hilarious.\n\nAs of yet I don't know of any firm plans for a memorial service or funeral. I expect there will be something at some point. It's still 2020 so patience, understanding, and empathy for the family are requisite virtues. Update: there will be a zoom memorial 12/19 at 1pm central.\n\nFrom Jen: \nIn lieu of flowers or food, I believe that Ian would like it if you could make a donation in his name to 2 of his favorite organizations.

It suggests that the word \"racist\" is so loaded and being a racist so abhorred that even folks who \"just hate n***ers\"  are unwilling to see themselves as such.

It takes enormous personal strength and character for a conservative to stand up to their overtly racist parents and say \"You're wrong, some black people are okay\". This may not be a fight you know but it is bloody and painful so lets not marginalize their efforts. It's not easier just because they're a generation or two behind. It's probably harder because hatred has roots and while racism may be a theoretical construct in lily white leftisttown it's woven into the fabric of life in the conservative south.

The driver of this dramatic improvement was the expanded child tax credit (from 2k to 3.6k/child). The two downsides are that even now there are still 3m American children living in poverty and that congress failed to renew the extended child tax credit thus it seems likely that in the forthcoming years much of this progress will be reversed and those 2.9m children will be plunged back into poverty. On the plus side it seems we now have a tool that works to alleviate poverty in children. Hopefully we'll have the sense to use it until the problem is solved.\n\n2) Controlled Nuclear Fusion works. Researchers at a US National Laboratory were able to create a nuclear fusion reaction that produced more energy than it consumes.Prior to this week it was uncertain that this was even possible. Nuclear fusion is how the sun creates power. It's commonly referred to as \"a star in a box\". Fusion bombs have existed for decades but are so powerful and terrible that they've never been used. It now appears likely that we can harness this power for something other than destruction. The downside is that we're still decades away from commercial fusion reactors being in use to power our homes. The plus side is that this is a nearly zero emission and nearly zero waste power source that absolutely dwarfs every other power source humanity has ever used. Technically it's not renewable energy but the fuel is water (hydrogen in the h20) and we have enough to power all of earth for billions of years. \n\nSometimes the US Federal Government does amazing things that can build a better future for all of humanity. We should absolutely celebrate these achievements.

Uranium One, a Canadian company, sold large US uranium mines to Russia while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. The allegation is that she made this happen in exchange for large donations to the Clinton Foundation from uranium investors. Spoiler Alert: This is makes no sense upon closer inspection. \n\nFirstly, these sales aren't unusual. We routinely sell mineral assets to foreign nations. China owns a ton of our natural gas reserves. The foreign nations buy it as a hedge against increasing energy prices (if the cost of the mineral goes up so does their profit from their resource). They're not buying this energy to use it or keep in their strategic reserve because they don't have access to it. If push came to shove it's not like the US would ever allow a foreign nation to mine resources on US soil to use against us even if that nation owned the resource. No matter who owns the resource the government regulates production, transport, and export the same. So owning a uranium mine doesn't give Russia any more access to uranium exports. Uranium is really only marketable for power plants Also, Kazakhstan exports more uranium than we do and if Putin wanted to own a resource he could actually exploit for the mineral (rather than a financial hedge) he would just buy in Kazakhstan. And he might have done that. I don't know anything about their industry.\n\nSecond, the amount of regulation on production, transport, and export of uranium (or any energy resource really) is extremely onerous.For example, in order to transport a certain type of crude the train cars are required to have different construction materials and techniques due to federal regulation. Every step is heavily regulated and overseen by multiple agencies at both the state and federal level. Remember the Dakota Access Pipeline and the permit issues? Remember the Keystone XL pipeline? And those are small regulatory hurdles compared to nuclear energy concerns in the US. Obama approved two nuclear plants in Georgia in 2010 (which have been smothered in regulations) and that's the first time since 77 that a new nuclear power plant was approved. The regulations are immense. There just isn't a scenario in which energy can just be exported under the table. That basically can't happen. In addition to onerous regulation of production and export there are multiple non-partisan review panels for the sale of major assets like the Uranium One sale. So I don't think it's plausible that Clinton could have gotten the deal passed the regulatory panels (particularly the ones in Wyoming where she is despised) if it would not have otherwise passed. As Secretary of State it's possible she could have cleared it through a sanctions issue and the job does involve promoting foreign direct investment in the US but that's just normal day to day function of the State Department.\n\nLastly, the donations don't seem connected to the sale (which also seems unconnected to Clinton). People who believe in the Al Gore vision of our energy future would naturally invest in both nuclear energy and the Clinton Global Initiative on climate change. It's investing in cap and trade or carbon taxes which is probably not a bad long term investment. I also think if you look deeper into the donations you'll find that the allegations don't hold up but this isn't my area of expertise. \n\nSo yeah, this Uranium One deal seems perfectly normal. These deals happen all the time. This isn't a nefarious deal. It isn't a particularly good deal for Russia. And it makes no sense that bribing a Clinton would be involved in any way. Some players in the energy industry are shady and we are all right to be suspicious about their safety, financial, and environmental records but nothing about this seems off at all.", "1332463257": "2012-03-22 20:40:57 I badly want to produce 30,000 Sean Peyton masks and sell / give them to Saints fans at the home opener.", "1526335130": "2018-05-14 17:58:50 Israeli soldiers killed dozens of Palestinians today.

I'm shocked how conservative they are. The first three aren't even controversial in gun owner circles. The last two are polling around 50/50 among gun owners. These recommendations could have come from any responsible gun owners organization (which does not include the NRA). There is no seizing of weapons. There is no mention of ammunition availability. There is no mention of preventing groups of people from buying guns. There is no mention of open or concealed carry restrictions. No mention of reciprocity. They're just: study the issue, enforce and improve existing laws, and ban the production and sale of the most dangerous tools of mass shooters.\n\nI've included each policy proposal below along with my immediate thoughts on them.\n\n1) Let the CDC study gun violence and fund the research. \n--- I think it's a scandal that the CDC was barred from studying gun violence. The new spending bill likely rectifies that but doesn't provide any funding to actually do the research. This seems like an obvious no-brainer. People are dying. We don't have good answers. At least this way we can start looking for them in a serious way.\n\n2) Eliminate restrictions and modernize the ATF. \n--This is so obvious that every gun owner I've spoken with supports effective enforcement of the laws already on the books. It's possible our laws would be effective if the enforcement agency weren't catastrophically hamstrung. (personally, I don't care for the ATF but they're the people who enforce gun regulations and  the job is too important to not be done)\n\n3) Mandate universal background checks.\n-- I presume they mean every time a gun is sold no matter the circumstances of the sale. I would go further and include every time a gun changes ownership for any reason. In some states this is effectively already the law. But background checks is one of those areas in which underfunding and hamstringing the ATF has undercut the law. Most people who fail background checks do so because it's illegal for them to attempt to purchase a gun. In theory the ATF should arrest and charge most people who fail background checks. Doing so would put real teeth in the background check system and is just enforcing the laws on the books already.\n\n4) Ban magazines with capacity greater than 10 rounds.\n-- I've played with high cap mags before and they're fun as hell to unload. I will miss the high-cap mag when it's gone but they're so dangerous that they probably should be regulated out of the hands f the general public. They're fun to shoot but they're made for mass shootings. That's why they exist. Eliminating these or requiring them to remain locked away in a licensed gun range won't stop mass shootings but it'll make it harder, more expensive, and easier to mess up. There is an argument about being able to resist the military if it came to that but we should have a moment of honesty here: unless we're going to have privately owned tanks, fighter jets, nuclear weapons, and heavy artillery then we can't effectively resist the military by force. There is no reason to think high cap mags are going to make any difference except that they're costing civilian lives in this time of peace. \n\n5) Ban future production or sale of assault weapons for civilian use and implement a buy back or registration program for the existing assault weapons. \n--They don't define assault weapons here except for \"weapons of war\". But I think it's safe to say this includes the AR-15 and other high powered semi-automatic rifles. I presume they don't include hunting rifles or shot guns or sport shooting rifles. I love shooting guns. Emptying a high capacity magazine through an assault rifle with my friends in the woods is a good time. I have fond memories and expect to do this again. That said, the difference between shooting assault rifles with high cap mags vs hunting or sport shooting rifles with low cap mags is pretty small. Yes, bigger is more fun but not by enough to justify how dangerous they are. By this plan we could still go out and shoot them they would just have to be registered and I would not be able to buy a new one. And really, if I could go to a shooting range and go shooting there with the rifles they own, maintain, and register then I, and I think most people who like to shoot, would feel no major loss here. That might actually be more fun if they had more expensive or fully automatic rifles. But like the high-cap mags these are designed to shoot people in mass. They're too dangerous to justify keeping them around because they're slightly more fun than shooting a rifle that is vastly less deadly. And, again, the resisting the military argument holds no water here either. \n\nI realize banning assault rifles is controversial and might violate the second amendment but we rightly ban military weapons of all kinds (nukes, nerve gas, machine guns, etc) because they're just too dangerous to be made publicly available. The assault rifle dramatically multiplies the legality of a individual so much that we should keep them off the streets like we do machine guns. \n\nThese suggestions won't stop gun violence (they might not even dent gun violence)  and they probably won't stop mass shootings. But they will make it harder for an individual to kill lots of people in very little time if we enact these changes. \n\nhttps://marchforourlives.com/how-we-save-lives/", "1487620215": "2017-02-20 14:50:15 This is why presidents day is a holiday but not election day.

It's a good way to see a first symphony performance. Even if you've seen a few this will still be a fun night out. (That said there is a cheaper, possibly free, alternative Nosferatu (10/24 @ 7:30 Scottish Rite Temple) where they'll play the old Dracula move and have the West Edge String Quartet playing the sound track live. It'll be a cool experience but not the same as the full symphony playing songs you already know.)\n\n2) Mardi Gras: The Sound of New Orleans (2/1 @7:30) - Byron Stripling is the guest artist on this one and he's a hell of a trumpet player. It'll be mostly Jazz, some Dixie Land, some big band, and who knows what else. It's going to be faster paced and an absolute blast. I can't remember the last time I was this excited about a symphony show.\n\n3) From the New World (5/3 @ 7:30) Le tombeau de Couperin is delightful. I don't know anything about the other piece in the first half but the first half matters not. After intermission is the New World Symphony by Anton\u00c3\u00adn Dvo\u00c5\u0099\u00c3\u00a1k in it's entirety. It's a great symphony that's both musically deep and really entertaining to hear. It's the symphony being The Symphony in all it's might and glory. Before music was made to be recorded the experience of seeing a symphony played live was a physical and auditory event. This is one of those symphonies. 70ish exceptionally talented artists collaborate on a truly great piece of music in a way that really can not be recorded. They can capture the sound but they can't capture the Symphony.\n\nHoliday Pops (12/21 @ 7:30, 12/22 @2:30) will be fun and should have been in there but I prefer the I-49 Brass Quintet (12/6 @ 7:00 -Broadmoor Presbyterian Church) and their Gary Schlecta show over the classic Christmas tunes (it's also cheaper). The next choice that should be here is Concierto de Aranjuez (4/5 @ 7:30) which is a Spanish Guitar concert and will be pretty amazing guitar and latin music. They have a Wagner and Strauss show (11/16 @ 7:30) and while I love those two they're not playing my favorite songs so they can be tied for fourth with the other two and Mozarts Requiem (3/8 @ 7:30) which is one of the all time great works of music but is ultimately a funeral mass.", "1604258041": "2020-11-01 14:14:01 Trump is up 1 in PAs most recent poll.

We're never going to be great again until southern blacks are full and equal participants in our society. We're a long way from it and they deserve better. So do the rest of us.\n\n2) The women who spoke out against Roy Moore are heroic. I don't know this but I'm guessing their lives have been much harder since speaking out. They've had to re-live the assault from Moore in front of the entire country only to be called liars by many of their neighbors and elected officials. Roy Moore is a monster and if his public life is over it'll be because these women killed him and for that we should all thank them. \n\n3) I thought after Jon Bel Edwards (d) beat David Vitter (R) for the Louisiana governor the GOP would  realize the south is too proud to vote for a monster in republican clothing. But then they voted for Trump who is absolutely a monster so I'm glad to get another data point suggesting southern people, my people, aren't going to vote for monsters.\n\n4) The southern black church is the bulwark of American decency while the white evangelical church needs to do some soul searching by that I mean they need to figure out where they lost it because it's been gone for a while now. I hope the American community of faith can follow leaders like Rev William Barber III and abandon the likes of Franklin Graham. If the church is going to be a thing in America in a generation - and I hope that it is - they need to end this Faustian bargain with the GOP.\n\n5) Governor Kay Ivy clarified an old law designed to disenfranchise black voters in such a way as to re-enfranchise people who have been convicted of low level felonies like drug possession. 144,000 voters were able to vote for the first time in this election for the first time. America shouldn't be denying the right to vote to any citizen unless they're convicted of treason. We should be doing everything we can to increase the number of people who vote in our elections and the folks who work both thanklessly and tirelessly to restore the rights of these Americans are making a huge difference. 1.6M people in Florida have been stripped of the vote. Here is a group trying to fix that: https://florida.ourstates.org/\n\n6) If the Alabama GOP is looking for new leadership (hint: they should be) I suggest looking to folks who put country over party and voted for Doug Jones. Y'all need folk who have a moral compass and a spine. Disgraced former governor Bentley appointed then AG Luther Strange to the senate while he was being investigated by Strange. That's not the act of a man with morals. Neither is accepting such an arrangement. Roy Moore was a monster but the Alabama GOP establishment isn't much better.\n\n7) If you're a good decent person and a strong candidate thinking about running for office in an election that is historically opposed to your views you should run. There should be republicans running in NYC and democrats running in Alabama. Obviously, victory is possible in any situation. Those unopposed ballots are what make the extreme candidates like Roy Moore possible. We should be running Democratic Socialists, Libertarians, and everyone in between.", "1515358482": "2018-01-07 15:54:42 My cell phone has died beyond my ability to resuscitate it which has forced me to listen to the radio instead of my beloved podcasts.

If you've never read them I would recommend reading the one linked below. It's from the 27th. But if you don't have the time I copied his comments about the Saudi war on Yemen and US involvement here. \n\nSome background on the Saudi-Yemini war. This isn't a war so much as it is a slaughter. Saudis claim the Iranian backed  Houthi are terrorists. They seem themselves as legitimate religious, tribal, and political entities. They're insurgents who acquired some power in what is left of the government of Yemen. Their legitimacy is debated. I have not seen evidence that they have engaged in terrorism but I would not likely see it if it exists. The Houthis do not have the forces threaten Saudi Arabia in any meaningful way in combat. They have some rockets they've been shooting into Saudi Arabia to little effect and have been somewhat effective in defensive ground fighting. The Saudis have overwhelming force and equipment but haven't been able to rout the Houthis. Think US vs Taliban for a combat level equivalent. The Houthis can't win but they might not lose.\n\nThe war has been an absolute horror story on the humanitarian front. The civilian casualties are very high though an accurate count is not possible, the government has essentially collapsed, there is a cholera epidemic which has killed thousands of people, and there is a famine brewing which will starve about 8m people. Another 11m are in a state of food crisis accoring to the UN. It is a disaster to such a degree that some consider it genocide.\n\nAnd the US is involved on the Saudi side. \n\nSpecifically, the US is involved with the arming, training, and planning missions on the Saudi side. \n\nI oppose this war and the US involvement in it but I wanted to paste Sec Mattis' comments here to show how complex the issue of US involvement is. Things I thought were notable from this exchange: The official recognition that we are involved with the planning of missions, How much less professional the Saudi military is than the US military (and how delicately Mattis explains that), and how we're trying to minimize the damage the less professional Saudi military creates while using US weapons. \n\n(Also, I'm not an expert. My facts or understanding here may be incorrect. It's obviously a controversial issue and the actual truth is hard to ascertain. If anyone notices any inaccuracies or unfair characterization in what I've said please mention it. I like to be as accurate as I can be.)\n\nSEC. MATTIS:  Yeah.  What the -- when you look at such things are air refueling -- when you're a pilot in the air and you've got bombs on your wing and you got somebody calling on you to drop and you're watching you fuel gauge go down, you say, \"No, you don't.  We're going to refuel you.  There's no need for a rash or hasty decision there.\"\n\nWhen we're doing the planning, we have shown them how you have what we call no-strike zones.  These are places where, because there are schools or hospitals -- but it's not as easy as just saying, \"Okay, there's a school or hospital; now, draw a circle around it on a map.\"  Now it's got to go up into the airplane.  Now the people who are calling for strikes have got to be aware.  Sometimes you add to them; you found a new place where you didn't have it on the map before.\n\nSo this is a very dynamic sort of battlefield management.\n\nWe have officers there that make certain that that is brought up and the process for bringing it right into the pilots and the decision-making has been proven by pilots saying \"Not gonna drop.  I don't think I can miss the no-strike area adjacent to that target.\"\n\nSo you see this sort of maturation.  Some of you have gotten very used to the U.S. military's ability to do this sort of thing, and we're not perfect about it.  But other countries, this is -- this is the trigonometry level of warfare.  And it -- so we're helping on that, as well.\n\nFull Transcript:\nhttps://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1477375/media-availability-with-secretary-mattis-at-the-pentagon/", "1264835674": "2010-01-30 02:14:34 I made a deal with myself that I could lavishly enjoy the game sonlong as I was willing to donate the cost to Cite Lespwa.

Admittedly it's not a high bar when the competition is Fukishima, the Deep Water Horizion, and strip mining.I do not believe any renewable energy technologies will account for a significant portion of the American energy mix over the next twenty years.

For me, the crux of the question down to this: Did the fracking boom set renewable energy behind by forcing down the cost of energy or did renewable need the time to become viable? Coal peaked in 2008 and the shale boom started in 2006. By the time the boom fizzled in 2016 coal production went from 1.2B tons to 736M tons. In the fight against climate change taking coal out of the energy mix and replacing it with fracked gas is a big long term win though not necessarily in the short term (methane is worse than CO2 initially but escapes the atmosphere in a decade or two  while CO2 remains for at least 1,000 years). The environmental damage to things like water supplies is less than the damage from coal mining and doesn't endanger the entire planet but is still a huge problem as are the earthquakes in heavily fracked areas that are not on fault likes like Dallas. \n\nOn a geopolitical front domestic natural gas production has 100% ended our dependency on foreign sources of energy. We may never go to war for oil again. (Well, a rational president wouldn't take us to war for oil anyway) We can also push back on oil powers like Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Norway because they no longer hold as much leverage over our economy. Also, cheaper energy prices bolster economies around the world. I'm 100% for bolstering the global economy particularly if it benefits the least developed areas. I think this is a win for fracking.\n\nGood: decreasing coal use, decreasing oil use, ending dependency on foreign sources of energy.\n\nBad: may have delayed better (greener) solutions to our energy mix, non-climate change environmental damage may prove to be significant and long lasting.\n\nAs for Aubrey McClendon, I have much less tolerance for his type of corporate shadiness.

Near the end Fidel Castro saw the future of Cuba as a member of the modern western.

It is overwhelmingly in the best interests of the US and Cuba for us to embrace their transition. We should be friends. \n\nBut this will require significant and important statecraft.

But I haven't quite aligned it all in my mind. \n\nI'm using Value to mean something of use rather than a representation of value like currency. Saving a kid from drowning is extremely Valuable though not fungible and you can't trade it. You can trade gold but it's comparatively useless beyond its ability to facilitate trade. \n\nIron, for instance, is a much more Valuable metal than gold. It's abundant, it's strong (or can easily be made strong), it's holding up our buildings, basically everyone uses iron basically everyday. Iron adds Value to society. It's improving lives all day every day all over the world. \n\n(Is there a better word for value to society vs monetary value? I suspect some folks would rather not recognize the difference. I'll use big V Value for social good and little v value for tokens of exchange)\n\nThe value store aspect of gold is based on scarcity and peoples willingness to accept it in trade. Being scarce is a negative not a positive.  (Scarcity is outdated but that's another topic altogether.) \n\nI think of cryptocurrency, as it's currently operating,(a term coined in the same novel as this quote) is basically a negative Value store. It burns extremely useful energy to create a scarce object (crypto coin) which has no use beyond facilitating trade. It represents only the destruction of Value.  If gold is the corpse of Value, crypto is a bounty payment for the killing of Value.\n\nWhich leads to an interesting question: is excess wealth of any kind a corpse of Value? I tend think it is. In theory, wealth is the residual effect of the creation of societal Value. But reality disproves that theory. Wealth is an accumulation of little v value not societal Value. Teachers create an enormous amount of Value but rarely accumulate enough value to have excess wealth. Crypto miners create almost no Value but do, or did, accumulate enough value to create excess wealth. \n\nWhile excess wealth is to social Value as lemon lacroix is to the juice of a lemon, being unrelated to Value is not the same as being a corpse of Value. Maybe there was a time when excess wealth was built by providing societal Value but it would have been more than a lifetime ago and inherited wealth no longer the result of Value. However, excess wealth may prevent the creation of Value in the name of value. So maybe excess wealth is the castration of Value? I'm not sure if there is enough Value in excess wealth to make a proper corpse of it. \n\nThe degree to which our tokens of trade are unrelated to the creation of societal Value is a bit troubling. \n\nI obviously need to think on this more and would appreciate any insight y'all may have.", "1472516697": "2016-08-29 20:24:57 I don't think I've ever wanted a commercial to be remade and updated until now.

I think he's the best GOP President since Eisenhower but America still bears the scars of his indifference to the suffering of people he apparently didn't think worth helping.\n\nWe ought to all thank him for a lifetime of service from joining the military at 17 after Pearl Harbor all the way to humanitarian work in his dying days. I ought to share this 3 min debate question that, I think, still could be blueprint for honest and compassionate republicans.  We should be grateful that he didn't take a victory lap when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, though it might have made him invulnerable in his 1992 election, and went to the work of seamless German re-unification instead. Think of how strong a partner Germany is for the US and how good the EU has been for global stability. GHWB absolutely deserves some credit for the strength of our strongest ally. He lost the election in 1992 to Bill Clinton and went on to support him for the good of the country. He voted for Hillary because he knew Trump was fundamentally unfit to be President. (He was the most qualified president since Eisenhower. Hillary would have been second.) I think the amount of courage he showed by remaining a public figure in his last years despite being visibly older and less able than he was in his prime is heartwarming and often overlooked. Great men used to hide away in their old age ashamed of what the years did to their bodies and abilities. Not GHWB. Once wheelchairs became his best form of mobility he started wearing interesting socks knowing that the image of him in a wheelchair didn't have to be one of a dying shell of a person but that wheelchair users - even very old ones - live vibrant lives an the imaged of him should reflect that for the nation to see. For these reasons, and many others, the good side of his scale is heavy with accomplishment. \n\nBut the other side is heavy too. He absolutely and unforgivably ignored the aids crisis. He was complicit in and lied about the Iran Contra affair. The Road of Death in Iraq (US Troops ambushed, trapped, and slaughtered retreating Iraqis) is by definition a war crime. His method of campaigning - particularly the infamously racist Willie Horton ad - has led the GOP down a dark road which has led to our current fractured state.  While polite and good to individual people he clearly didn't care about black lives during the crack epidemic, he didn't care about gay lives during the aids epidemic, he didn't care about Iranian or Nicaraguan lives during Iran Contra and he didn't care about Iraqi lives on the road of death.

This is stupidly dangerous. In order to use this process they have to make the change budget neutral (or better) which mean they have to cut the expenditures without cutting the income so the net effect is the worst of both worlds. It'll also reduce the votes needed for full repeal which not only circumvents the filibuster but it also allows the GOP to repeal without even a GOP consensus. Right now there are a handful on GOP congressmen who support repeal and replace but not full repeal or repeal then - at some undetermined later date - replace. \n\nThe biggest issue for the GOP is the timing. House members want to repeal before their next election in 2 years. Senators want to wait until after the 2020 election because they know what happens to a party when they kick 22m people off of their health insurance. Most republicans want to keep provisions like expanded medicaid, staying on parents insurance to 26, and no denials for pre-existing conditions (because they're not monsters). But that will take a grand debate and bargain among the GOP to get the timing, budget, and regulation in order (as it should) but they don't have a viable alternative yet and its been 6 years. \n\nThe danger with this process is that'll make it so a moment of political necessity (an election/scandal/whatever) could result in a ham fisted full repeal and cost 22m people their insurance. If they do without a viable replacement people who are truly sick, or injured, or have on expensive medication might never be able to get insurance again. Insurance don't take pre-existing conditions unless the law says they have to.  \n\nThis is like taking the safety off of a loaded gun pointing it in the general direction of millions of Americans and saying \"don't worry, we'll figure out what we're shooting at later but we don't think it'll be you\".", "1540657088": "2018-10-27 12:18:08 This part is agonizing.

Usually public health crises affect marginalized people more than white people but not this one. I'd love to know why. Is it that poor white people are poorer than ever and this is just poverty in disguise? I suspect it has something to do with my next observation.\n3) The most dangerous guns to a minor, with the possible exception of black boys, are by far the guns in their own homes. About 1/3 of the firearm deaths of children are suicides and accidents (it's mostly suicide). \n\nI don't know what portion of children who die by gun live in a gun owning home but I suspect it's more than half.

These are psychologically hard times for everyone and people are going to react differently. These people are probably just afraid and incapable of accepting what's happening around them. They're also the subjects of a well funded propaganda campaign to drive their perfectly reasonable fear to this absurd political end. \n\nI think the people in the pictures want the outcomes of not being afraid and feeling powerful or being able to protect and provide for the people they care about. I assume they brought their guns to get news coverage and in a petty attempt at intimidation. But they bought those guns because they believe, or want to believe, that the threat to the people and things they care about is othered people. \n\nAnd now they don't know what to do. The fact that other people are what's saving them from the threat to everything they care about is probably too discordant to believe. They expected this to be a shooting time not a staying time.\n\nSo they're at home with nothing to do but be afraid and listen to lies about how none of this is real and they can act and end this if they just do what the propaganda tells them to. What we're seeing in those pictures is trauma.

No surprise judge races, city officials, etc. I was out in 5 bubbles and I already knew how I would vote on all 5. \n\nJoy: I was able to vote for a diversity of political thought and backgrounds that I think would represent and serve my community and me very well. \n\nOne major state wide candidate is center-right: They support more policing, cutting the corporate tax rate 60%, pardons for minor possession of pot, unions, raising the minimum wage,  and election reform while opposing mask/vaccine mandates,  abortion restrictions, and the death penalty.\n\nAnother major state wide candidate is center-left. They're pro policing, pro-pot legalization, pro union, pro wealth tax, pro $15/hr minimum wage, pro universal healthcare, and anti war.\n\nA district wide candidate that covers Pittsburgh is a squad level leftist. They're a democratic socialist (like Bernie Sanders) who supports the green new deal, medicare for all, police reform, ending mass incarceration, free college, a pathwy to citizenship, reproductive rights, and supreme court expansion.\n\nThose three candidates encapsulate their constituents well. Pennsylvania is a centrist swing state while Pittsburgh is a liberal city. I was glad to vote for all of these candidates and feel I would be well represented by the diverse political thought this set. \n\nGripe: There wasn't a real honest choice to make in any of these three elections. The democratic primary voters gave us those three candidates and their diverse positions. The gop primary voters gave us nothing of any value. They nominated a Jan 6th rioter for governor, a guy who has never lived in PA for senate, and a for the house race they nominated a person whose only qualification is that they have the same name as the retiring democrat incumbent.

I've noticed there is some interest in what it is like to go on dates now among people who already knew this about me. I'm willing to have a conversation about it either here for via pm if you have questions.  Here are the answers to the questions I have already gotten. \n\n- I do not think of marriage as the only valid reason to date and recommend against that approach.\n- I think each date is good and valuable. Even if it doesn't lead to another, I've met a person, I've learned a thing, and probably had a pretty decent cup of coffee.\n- I don't divulge identifying details about people with whom I go on dates. \n- For me, going out on dates is fun even as a 36 year old person. The people I go on dates with are generally in their 20s and 30s though I don't care about how old a person is. \n- flirting via text is hard. I don't know how to emoji. One person keeps sending me three upside down question marks and I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. \n- #metoo has made dating a hell of a lot better. It's certainly different. But it's much better. \n- Dat communication tho.\n- Sometimes dates go really well. Sometimes I bomb hard. Most of the time it's fun. Even bombing is fun sometimes. Other times it's a bummer. Often people no show.\n- First dates are usually short. Second dates are usually great. I don't go on a lot of third dates.\n- I tend to use OkCupid to source people with whom to go on dates.  Options abound. I experiment with other platforms. What is good for me might not be good for you.\n- I do no think my dating experience is typical. \n- I try to decide if I want to go on a date with a person based on that person regardless of  their circumstances. \n- I'm not entirely clear with myself on my motives but it seems more capacity building than asset acquiring.\n- A lot of people I meet on OKC are in open or poly relationships. I go on dates with these people too.\n- I think location, culture, and population, make a major difference in how fun it is. In Pittsburgh, this is fun. This might not be fun in Shreveport.\n- Being my friend is better than being my date.  It certainly lasts longer. \n- I decided to go on dates again because I'm in Pittsburgh for several months so there is a chance something could go somewhere. That's not my goal but it's an exciting possibility.\n -Yes. \n\nWhile I'm on the topic, there are a number of folks I should have dated but didn't over many years. That was shitty of me.

His goals were wrong headed but he was brilliant about achieving them. He was able to resist a global superpower for decades with far more success than anyone expected. I think it would have been better for the Cuban people if he had been somewhat less successful but I can't deny his success. I't s instructive to look at the responses form President Obama and juxtapose it against that of Donald Trump. (I've included them below)\n\nTrumps statement probably makes Cuban Americans feel vindicated that Castro was a bad guy but it forces Cuba away from the US and back into it's communist fold. The Presidents statement gives room for the Cuban government to continue to actually make Cubans more free and move Cuba away from communism. It doesn't feel as good as calling someone out but it actually does the important thing. \n\nUnder President Obama the Cubans have made significant strides toward free market economies, improved human rights, and becoming a member of the \"free\" world for the firs time in 60 years. That only happens by creating avenues for progress rather than shutting them down by loudmouthing about their founding hero. When you disrespect a nation they will not be willing to work with you toward your goals. In claiming that Trump that his administration will finally put Cuba on the path to Freedom he has actually stunted the significant progress that President Raul Castro, President Obama, and Pope Francis have working toward down that path.\n\nWhat you say matters. When you're the President or presidential candidate it matters a lot. Trumps mouth has set back Cuban US relations and stunted Cubas move away from communism.\n\nThis is President Obamas response:\nAt this time of Fidel Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in Cuba and in the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.\nFor nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.\nToday, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.\n\nThis is Trumps response:\nToday, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.\nWhile Cuba remains totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.\nThough the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.

The Obama administration used this capacity to assassinate Anwar al-Awlaki a US citizen and alleged senior recruiter for Al Qaeda. Many Obama supporters opposed this move (myself included) and urged him to cancel the program of extra judicial assassination. Not because we lacked faith that Obama would use the power wisely (I don't mourn Anwar, but he should have had due process) but because this kind of power attracts evil people to it and nobody knows who's next to wield it.\n\nNow we know who's next: white supremacist sympathizer Steve Bannon has been appointed to the National Security Council and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff (the top military official) and the Director of National Intelligence (the top intelligence official) were removed. The people who now have the power to assassinate US citizens will no longer hear dissent from the military and intelligence communities. \n\nThe first clandestine operation under the new administration, ostensibly to capture computers containing information, resulted in the deaths of at least 30 people including 10 women and children and 2 Americans Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a Navy Seal, and Nora al-Awlaki, Anwars 8 year old daughter.\n\nIt appears the Trump administration is keeping it's campaign promise to go after the families of it's enemies including 8 year old American girls. \n\nWe won't know what actually happened in this raid but we should not sacrifice the lives of our soldiers for this.

Here's an update: Mubarak would step down the next day and the military took over. At the time the military was seen as independent, professional, and effective so this wasn't a coup but rather a theoretically peacefulish transition of power. The military did what it swore it would and held relatively free and fair elections in May of 2012. The winner was Mohammad Morsi of the Freedom and Justice party which is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Morsi then annulled the limits on presidential power the military decreed before the election. He also asked for the resignation of the heads of the military and promoted Abdel Fattah al-Sisi from the head of Military Intelligence to supreme commander and later decreed that his decrees were not legally challengeable (but only until a new constitution would pass, of course). Folks didn't care for that and there were large scale riots. On July 1, 2013 the military issued an ultimatum that the political parties had 48 hours to meet the demands of the people or the military would. That day every minister (like a US cabinet post) not in the Muslim Brotherhood resigned. The next day Morsi rejected the 48 hour ultimatum. The day after the military removed Morsi and announced the head of the Constitutional Court Adly Mansour as the interim president. But folks don't like coup d'etat against their democratically elected president either so the protests continued. The military handled them militarily and killed a lot of protestors (638 killed 4k wounded ). Again the military delivered quick elections in May of 2014 but dispensed with that free and fair nonsense. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi resigned from the military to run, faced one opponent, and won with 96% of the vote. His term ends in 2018 and he can seek reelection only once. In theory. While Sisi isn't great for democracy he might not be terrible for Egypt right now. If he can stabilize the country and keep ISIS out and give up power in legitimate elections (and it looks like he's on pace there) then he could perhaps be an Abraham Lincoln like figure for Egypt. Of course he could also turn into yet another brutal dictator. Also, in May of 2015 Morsi and 105 of his friends were sentenced to death for inciting violence.

I'm pretty sure the age spread in my class was greater than 20 years. We had several parents and sometimes kids came to class, we had at least one immigrant, we had an electrician, a person who did art for grocery stores, a photographer, a shoe salesman, a person who sold vintage postcards on etsy, a video editor, an engineer, a library volunteer, and a number of unemployed people who decided to make their next job more lucrative than their last one. Some of us had college degrees others hadn't been in a class since high school. My class was a bouquet of bad-asses. \n\n It is central to reason Academy exists that people who are underrepresented in tech are affirmatively enabled to join the industry. Don't feel like this isn't for you unless you're not interested or can't afford to go unpaid from 9-5 m-f for 12 weeks.Otherwise, academy is a thing you can do while broke. They will provide a laptop if you don't already have one. Your age, educational background, gender, orientation, economic status, criminal history, disability, health, family need, etc are not going to be an issue. (I didn't even have a permanent address when I applied. I had an air mattress in friends second bedroom and only bought a bed when I knew I would have to be in town for 6 months). \n\nI think would be a good opportunity for artists who aren't going to be in day time rehearsal for the next 3 months but want more lucrative side hustles. Sex workers, bar tenders, retirees,  people living in shelters, parolees, anybody who wants to get into tech should apply and they will absolutely consider you. \n\nThe decision tree should be 1) do I have an interest in programming? 2) can I afford to not get paid 9-5 m-f for 12 weeks? \n\nIf the answers were yes you should apply.\n\nNow, I don't mean to suggest Academy is easy - it's definitely not. But I am saying people who don't think of them selves as \"tech people\" can definitely do this.

It's a dymaxion map (aka Fuller projection) which is by far my favorite projection of the Earth. Anytime a 3d object, like a sphere, is rendered in 2d compromises have to be made. The most common world map, the Mercator projection, sacrificed relative size and positioning of the continents to create a rectangular map and north is up orientation. Near the equator the map is correct then skews badly as it gets closer to the poles. The map sacrifices being a square to keep the relative size of continents correct. It also dispenses with the falsehood that north is up. Earth is a sphere. It doesn't have a top or an up. \n\nI like this projection because it accurately reflects the Earth as being a singular thing, like one big island, rather than collection of many things. I love that it has no borders. This orientation is my favorite because it's easy to envision human migration starting in Africa then being shaken out into the the Middle East and Europe then just plinking down to South America. \n\nBut my favorite thing about this map is that by showing the world in a different more connected way it's easier to view our world as a singular interconnected place.

Former president Lula da Silva defeated current president Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff election. The reason that election is so important is because the Amazon rainforest is located in Brazil, can (could?) absorb 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, and was being burned down under president Bolsonaro to the point where the rainforest was(is) emitting more carbon due to the fires and deforestation than it was capturing. \n\nMost of the deforestation under Bolsonaro was technically illegal but promoted by Bolsonaro who prevented the enforcement of relevant laws. In addition to the cliamate ramifications this illegal logging and burning also created clashed between the loggers/ranchers (Much of the burned rainforest was intended to be used as cattle ranches for beef export) and indigenous people living in the Amazon. These clashes often resulted in the un punished murder of the indigenous population. The amazon is(was?) also the most biodiverse place on earth and some of the biodiversity loss to logging and burning will never return.\n\nThe election of Bolsonaro had consequences that will never be repaired. The election of Lula da Silva will likely slow then stop the damage but he can't undo the destruction of a 10 million year old rainforest in a 4 year term. \n\nReal progress is slow. Real damage is fast. Climate scientists were treating this election as an extencial crisis for the future of human life on this planet. Lula won 50.9% to 49.1% for Bolsonaro (who has not yet conceded). \n\nElections have consequences.\n\nOn the graphic: The yellow part of this graph represents the previous two terms of Lula da Silva during which the rate of deforestation dropped dramatically. The orange section shows the one term of Jair Bolsonaro during which the rate dramatically increased. For some scale you could fit the entire country of Belgium or commonwealth of Massachusetts  in the area deforested under Bolsonaro (in orange).

Trump said he's going to take care of the heroin epidemic and this would be the most decisive action to combat addiction in US history.  \n\nThere is a director level position dedicated to long term care. Trump said he's going to take care of seniors and this bill provides for long term in home and community care reserving institutional care for only those cases where the \"highest quality and most effective care\" can only be delivered via institutional care.\n\nIt covers all individuals residing in the country (including territories) for all medically necessary treatment, medication, hospitalization, emergency services, durable medical equipment and anything else deemed medically necessary (see more under Bad:) \n\nI, virtually all Americans, and all 50 states would save money as prices are negotiated as a single purchasing block. (see more under Bad:) \n\nThe regressive taxes on the flyer aren't actually in the bill (see more under Bad:)\n\nThis bill would almost certainly be the most significant piece of health care legislation in US history and would likely provide the best preventative health care in US history.\n\nQuestionable:\nThere is a powerful oversight board of 15 new presidential appointees serving 6 year terms.\n\nThe bill is very light on details and a lot of important sections are left to the secretary to decide. \n\nFor profit providers of and insurers of  medically necessary services would functionally cease to exist in the United States. People who lose jobs are allotted 2 years of income, training, and preferred hiring in any created positions.\n\nDoctors, hospitals, insurance companies, medical device companies, and pharmaceutical companies are going to make vastly less money. \n\nStates maintain control of licensure for medical professionals. \n\nBad:\nNot one mention of sexual or reproductive health. \n\nReligion and national origin did not make this list: \nSEC. 403. REDUCTION IN HEALTH DISPARITIES.\nIt is the intent of this Act to reduce health disparities by race, ethnicity, income and geographic region, and to provide high quality, cost-effective, culturally appropriate care to all individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or language.\n\nThe bill institutes 3 new taxes on unearned income, stock and bond transactions, and payroll/self employment income (this presumably replaces the current medicare tax on payroll and self employment income). These taxes are not specified but referred to as \"modest\" or \"small\". \n\nThe bill increases personal income tax on the top 5% of income earners but does not specify by how much.\n\nThe bill is generally lacking in math.\n\nThis bill won't pass.\n\nThis is decidedly not the version of healthcare that is being leaked by house republicans. (I assume it's being leaked today because the house GOP doesn't want HR 676 to be THE version of Trumpcare. This bill would actually(ish) meet Trumps promise to provide better healthcare to every citizen for less money. It does so mostly by negotiating prices for drugs and medical services as one big national consumer block with 320M members. Trump likes to negotiate.

The departments of Housing and Urban Development, Veteran Affairs, and Labor created a joint program called HUD-VASH which partners with cities to contact potentially homeless veterans, find a home for them, provide them with vouchers to pay for it, give them access to any VA medical, counseling, or other services they need and job training if needed within days of locating the veteran. A lot of red tape had to be cut for this to work (agency laws were rewritten) and I think 100% of the money is coming from the executive discretionary budget but it appears to be working. It's not unreasonable to think we can and will reach functionally zero homeless veterans in every American city in the next few years. It'll be a proud day for America when we can send veteran homelessness to the dustbin of history and that day, finally, appears to be coming.\n\nIf you know a homeless veterans look into this HUD - VASH thing. \n\nWhen we work together we can do great things but we can also do good things.", "1465694640": "2016-06-11 21:24:00 Everyone self identifies as a bunch of things (mother, Christan, American, engineer, traveler, musician, feminist, biker, athlete, etc).

Passed in 1793 and signed into law by George Washington the law allowed slave hunters to ignore local laws while rounding up and deporting escaped slaves back into slavery. However, freedom loving people in free states generally kept people living in their states out of the hands of slave hunters. In 1850 the law was amended to make it a crime to not help the slave hunters. Abolitionists revolted and dared the authorities to arrest them. The law was abolished during the civil war. \n\nI think every American familiar with it now realizes this was a bad law. The idea that the law would enslave people, re-enslave people, force abolitionists to re-enslave people, and override state and local laws in order to satisfy statues of chattel properties is unjust and inhumane. What the slave hunters and the politicians who passed these laws did was both legal and absolutely wrong. The abolitionists and authorities in free states who defied these laws are American heroes despite breaking American law. \n\nThe American story, from the Boston Tea Party, to the Revolutionary War, to the Underground Railroad, to the march on Montgomery is one of patriots refusing to honor unjust laws. America was born in that space between justice and legality and has been crawling towards justice for 250 years. \n\nI hope you've never wondered if you would side with British loyalists over the American revolutionaries, with slavers over freedom, or racism over justice.

In the past few weeks a team lead at Walmart gunned down many of his direct reports. That came off the heels of a taco bell manager shooting and killing one of his direct reports. \n\nMy first \"real\" job after college was managing people earning sub-living wages in a busy restaurant. Everything about that job sucks. I was making $16-17/hr and my reports were making $5.15-6/hr. There is something perverse the greed that causes a  wealthy person to threaten economic violence against a subsistence wage earner unless they commit economic violence against economically desperate sub-living wage earners. It was untenable then and now I suspect it's much worse.  \n\nBreaking desperate people for the extraction of profit isn't a business model. It's an exploitation engine. Physical violence is a predictable outcome of human exploitation.

The overlap between the two is the hellscape reality in which a person becomes injured or ill they often incur tremendous amounts of medial debt. (For the insured this maxes out at $17,400/year (Thanks Obama Care!). For the uninsured there is literally no limit and for serious situations the bills are regularly in the $100,000-$300,000 range/year. If you have a condition that needs ongoing treatment the amounts reset every year thus the debt grows every year.) When they patient can't pay the debt it is sold to a collection agency, whose job is to force the patient to pay the debt, and reported to the 3 credit reporting agencies who catalogue and score every Americans credit worthiness. The credit reporting agencies provide this information to lenders, employers, and anyone else who buys your credit report so they can charge the person more fees, higher rates, or simply deny them a financing or employment altogether. Each negative on a credit report stays for 7 years after the debt is paid or forever if the debt is not discharged. So if you are ill or injured in the United States and do not have excellent private insurance then you will also likely become bankrupt as a result. Making things worse - yes there is a worse - you can go to prison, denied government services, or denied freedom of movement depending on the kind of debt owned. And worse still - there is literally no bottom to this inferno - 16% of suicides in the US are related to finances.

It's been nearly 20 years since the last significant foreign terrorist attach on US soil. Even if you came to the mission after Bin Laden was captured this success is your success. \n\nThank you for educating and empowering a generation of Afghan women. A generation of educated women will benefit the Afghan people and Afghan families for at least one lifetime. That would not have happened without the service men and women keeping the fighting away form the classrooms.\n\nThank you for giving the Afghan government a chance. They had 20 years to figure out how to govern their own country. They had 20 years of training and funding by the best warfighters in the world to build a functional military and police force. That it wasn't enough is not a failure of the men and women who served there. It was a failure of diplomacy and of the Afghan government to figure out their future. Your service gave them ample time to do so. \n\nI know for many veterans every day is a hard day and these days may be especially difficult.

He is exactly the person we need as secretary of defense.\n\n When I have more time (I'm on the road to Louisiana) I'll write more in praise of Mattis. \n\nI think everyone should read his retirement letter and understand that his resignation came after the President decided to withdraw from Syria without consulting the military and that in doing so we are abandoning the Kurds, our most reliable ally in the region, who fear they will probably be slaughtered by the Turks. \n\nHere is the letter:\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nI have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.\n\nI am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\n\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.\n\nI pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.\n\nJames N.

Israel hates them back and both been preparing for a war with Hezbollah at some point. That point may well be nowish. Israel could easily defeat all of Lebanon in a military conflict but Hezbollah is believed to have thousands of missiles capable of hitting major Israeli cities so a war will have high civilian casualties for Israel (and probably Lebanon). \n\nThe Saudis are expected to use Israeli as a corridor to attack and it's possible the Saudi position that Lebanon has declared war on them may be an attempt to keep Israel out of the fight (or at least to prevent Hezbollah from firing their missiles at Israel since they'll need them for the Saudis). \n\nWhat would the US do? If Israeli cities are attacked with a barrage from Hezbollah it seems impossible that the US would stay out of it. The Trump administration is very anti-Iran and close to the Saudi branch that initiated the purge 4 paragraphs ago. I don't think anyone wants another war in the middle east but that certainly seems to be in the works. Russia is also much closer to Iran than Saudi Arabia so it could be a proxy war among our proxies. Syria is also potentially in play as neither the Saudis nor Israelis care for al-Assad.\n\nThe humanitarian fallout would be immense. Lebanon has been stellar in regards to the Syrian refugee crisis (still very much a major global concern). 25% of the people in Lebanon are Syrian refugees and a war there would obviously force them, as well as millions of Lebanese, elsewhere. Obviously the loss of human life in the conflict would be very high. It will likely create a power vacuum from which all manner of extremism can flourish (see: ISIS). And that is in addition to the Saudi led humanitarian nightmare in Yemen. \n\nHopefully this will all simmer down somehow and if we had a functional state department we could perhaps de-escalate the situation as we have in years past. We should all hope that it doesn't come to war and if it does that it'll be the swift and relatively painless sort but more likely it'll be brutal and the US will end up directly involved.", "1591811409": "2020-06-10 13:50:09 \"Defund the Police\" is a terrible slogan but a really good idea.\n\nWe shouldn't be paying for police to care for homelessness.

There are only three parties whose nominees will be on all 50 ballots in November: Democrat, Republican, Libertarian. Gary Johnson, the presumptive libertarian nominee polled at 11% in the most recent poll to include him and that's significant given that nobody has ever heard of him. If you feel like your party is shoving a candidate down your throat or that a candidate has been shoved down theirs send a third up on stage with them. There is nothing the party chairs want less than for their voters to have another option. I don't think Governor Johnson is even close to an ideal candidate but he would be the only person at the debates who thinks bombing the hell out of people is wrong. I think we need that view in our presidential debates and we need to remind the two main parties that we have other options for President and will not blindly vote for the D or R. \n\nThere are probably better candidates for President but the only one who is even close to the 15% threshold is Gary Johnson.
