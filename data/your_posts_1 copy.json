They were all classy respectful guys. +1 Minnesota.\n\nAfter the Roughing the Favre call fans started throwing beer bottles onto the field. This shows great disdain for the call considering how expensive said beer bottles were.\n\nThe entire city was in gridlock for at least 2 hours after the game ended. Many streets were mardi gras style packed but without the \"show me your tits\" douchbaggery that traditionally accompanies mardi gras. Everyone was jubilant, drunk, and hi-5ing a lot. My hand still hurts from the drive by hi-5ing. It was an awesome experience. If the win the Super bowl I expect it'll be about the same.\n\nTracy Porter has a pac-man themed haircut.

After the game I found myself doing math on Burbon street and realized that if I bought a round of handgernades, got a hotel room, and woke up next to a stranger the grand total of the weekend would be a nice round number for the Haitian orphans. Somehow I decided against this route. As a single, irresponsible, 20something male enjoying a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" (which should happen again in 2 weeks) I decided to sleep in BR. By not literally screwing some drunken party gal I was figuratively screwing the orphans. I felt pretty guilty about this scenario and needed another expense. 'Luckily' another expense found me. 75 in a 60. I got a speeding ticket on my way home. The fine drove the weekend total to a nice round number. I was actually relieved to get the ticket."

I also checked the owner of record for 349 Atlantic and it's not \"Carolyn Groner\". I then called the company that has the property listed for sale and they claim it's not for rent and that the owner is not \"Carolyn Groner\". I called Carolyn Groner and she has reported you to the FBI.\n\nNaturally, I have some questions about whether or not you own the property. Is there any way you can prove that you do have the right to rent the house? I'd be glad to look into the house and probably rent it provided that you can legitimately rent it to me. As you can see I'm quite diligent about all things real estate and would take excellent care of the property.\n\nI eagerly await your reply,\n\n-Tomas"

Mumbai \"suburbs\" > American suburbs. Mostly because Mumbai \"suburbs\" = big American cities. \n\nAlso, saw a man lying in the middle of the highway. Couldn't tell if he'd been hit yet or not. No one stopped because here, if you take someone into the hospital you are automatically a suspect. People constantly die in the road and from rather minor accidents because strangers won't help because they don't want to have to pay giant bribes to \"convince' the police that they weren't guilty. Our host had just been talking about that very thing before we went exploring, and then we saw it. So sad. Everyone says about India \"you just can't be prepared for it.\" But, they're wrong. People just need to actually learn things about the country they're going to before they get there.\n\nAnd now, I get to sleep next to an open window. It's a \"will I get malaria or other tropic diseases?\" game of chance! I had no vaccinations before this trip so it makes the game that much more fun"

They're probably all good but here are my top three that most folks will enjoy in no particular order. \n\n1) Movie Masterpieces II (10/26 @7:30): - It's movie music you'll know (The Godfather, Jaws, Indiana Jones, etc) and collaborating with Moonbot brings a visual element to an already fun show. It's a good way to see a first symphony performance. Even if you've seen a few this will still be a fun night out. (That said there is a cheaper, possibly free, alternative Nosferatu (10/24 @ 7:30 Scottish Rite Temple) where they'll play the old Dracula move and have the West Edge String Quartet playing the sound track live. It'll be a cool experience but not the same as the full symphony playing songs you already know.)\n\n2) Mardi Gras: The Sound of New Orleans (2/1 @7:30) - Byron Stripling is the guest artist on this one and he's a hell of a trumpet player. It'll be mostly Jazz, some Dixie Land, some big band, and who knows what else. It's going to be faster paced and an absolute blast. I can't remember the last time I was this excited about a symphony show.\n\n3) From the New World (5/3 @ 7:30) Le tombeau de Couperin is delightful. I don't know anything about the other piece in the first half but the first half matters not. After intermission is the New World Symphony by Anton\u00c3\u00adn Dvo\u00c5\u0099\u00c3\u00a1k in it's entirety. It's a great symphony that's both musically deep and really entertaining to hear. It's the symphony being The Symphony in all it's might and glory. Before music was made to be recorded the experience of seeing a symphony played live was a physical and auditory event. This is one of those symphonies. 70ish exceptionally talented artists collaborate on a truly great piece of music in a way that really can not be recorded. They can capture the sound but they can't capture the Symphony.\n\nHoliday Pops (12/21 @ 7:30, 12/22 @2:30) will be fun and should have been in there but I prefer the I-49 Brass Quintet (12/6 @ 7:00 -Broadmoor Presbyterian Church) and their Gary Schlecta show over the classic Christmas tunes (it's also cheaper). The next choice that should be here is Concierto de Aranjuez (4/5 @ 7:30) which is a Spanish Guitar concert and will be pretty amazing guitar and latin music. They have a Wagner and Strauss show (11/16 @ 7:30) and while I love those two they're not playing my favorite songs so they can be tied for fourth with the other two and Mozarts Requiem (3/8 @ 7:30) which is one of the all time great works of music but is ultimately a funeral mass."

Admittedly it's not a high bar when the competition is Fukishima, the Deep Water Horizion, and strip mining.I do not believe any renewable energy technologies will account for a significant portion of the American energy mix over the next twenty years. I also think the economic benefits of fracking warrant serious consideration. Basically, I think fracking is going to be good for the country but I understand not wanting it anywhere near your water supply.\n\nThe energy industry, of which I work on the periphery, is notoriously slow to adapt to social change or acknowledge models which no longer work. So I'm not surprised that they took a beating in the court of public opinion despite outspending their opponents 30-1. There is going to be a market for pro-energy internet activism. While I don't think this will actually stop fracking  in Colorado, the industry needs to be winning referendums like these. So if you're good at social engineering and have fungible beliefs on this issue there is apparently much money to be made showing the other side of this coin.\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/richardlevick/2013/11/07/colorado-rejects-fracking-the-moneys-not-talking-social-media-is/"

I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God. So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to mankind.\nArmistice Day has become Veterans' Day. Armistice Day was sacred.

Everyone on the team knew they were gay, and they knew that everyone knew they were gay. They didn't take that step of going public, but it never was an issue in my experiences. \"\n\nIn response to the shower question: \"Like I said, if you play in the league for any amount of time, you play with gay teammates. And you've showered with them, and you probably knew it, too. That's going to be an issue the media focuses on much more than players.\" \n\nUnsurprisingly, the gay barrier in the NFL locker room has already been broken and it did not become a major issue for the players or coaches.\n\n Hopefully, Sam enduring a few months on questions will allow other gay athletes to come out once people loving who they love is no longer news."

The universe is really big and this may be your best chance to experience it other than leaving the planet. If the weather is clear you have a really top shelf opportunity to see and learn some incredible things from folks who are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. Camp that weekend if you can. It was a truly brilliant experience last year.\n\nhttp://www.brastro.org/hgsp.html"

Below are the pros and cons as I see them of my particular situation right now. Ultimately, I don't love it but it does remove any threat of medical bankruptcy. Basically, if I need treatment I'll be able to afford it on May 1.\n\nI should point out that I am paying a full and unsibsidized price. I price checked the subsidies and if you make less than 400% of the poverty line you can get better insurance for cheaper or free in many cases.\n\nCons:\n- I don't like being forced into anything.\n- Despite a $4,000 deductible my plan is not eligible for a HSA (Health Savings Account) which is desirable with, and designed for, high deductible plans.\n- $2000/yr in premiums is $2000 more than I would have other wise spent.\n- Does basically nothing until I suffer (and pay for) $6,300 of medical need in a single year.\n- Does not incentivize going to the doctor for preventative maintenance.\n- No Dental, Visual, or Mental Health coverage. (I bought Dental for an extra $17/month)\n\nPros:\n- Relatively easy to get covered. (site sucks but no doctor visit, relatively little paperwork, can be done without shoes)\n- Pre-existing conditions do not matter (I could literally have full blown AIDS, Aggressive Cancer, Cebral Palsy, Diabetes, gangrene, meth addiction and a knife sticking out of my leg and still get covered for $185/month. Though they did ask if I used Tobacco.)\n-  Even with all the problems listed above $8,300 is the most I would have to pay for medically necessary anything in any one year. Which is a lot but not enough to bankrupt me. ($2000 premiums + $6,300 annual max)\n- Premiums are about half the price of the last time I priced insurance.\n- Inexplicably covers injury abroad.\n- Given that the insurance does almost nothing before $6,300 and quite a lot thereafter, I have no incentive to use in network doctors."

The NCAA vacated the wins because they wanted to remind everyone that winning football games should never come before the safety and well being of children. Pennsylvania disagreed, sued the NCAA, and ultimately won. Now they celebrate because football wins are still more important at PSU than children being raped on campus by a football coach. Repeatedly. For more than a decade."

That's a long time and far longer then his successor King Salman  (79 and sick) or now Crown Prince Murqin are likely to rule. Over their reigns the new king and crown prince will face some significant challenges. Iran is a bitter and possibly powerful enemy. The Saudis have an Al-Queda problem they're fighting in Yemen. Their human rights record is bad but improving. And, perhaps biggest of all, oil consumption may decline before Murqin passes the torch to the as of yet unnamed second in line. I've been paying attention mainly because Saudi Arabia has been able to flood the oil market thus crippling the economies of Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Thomas Scarlato. Is this power play related to the Saudi succession and will the new king keep up production? Interesting times in the oil world."

One thing I have noticed lately is people complaining about other people complaining but I never saw or heard the original complaint. Todays complain du jour is the starbucks cup. I've seen nobody complain about it being red or whatever the outrage is supposed to be but I've read a lot of complaining about the complaining that doesn't appear to be there. A cup or what people think about it is of zero import. When we waste our time and energy with unimportant things we ignore the things that matter. What's even worse is when we divide ourselves in an us v them fashion over something as stupid as a cup. Is it worth distancing yourselves from your neighbors? Is it worth expanding an ever less bridgeable gap? We should not allow ourselves to be divided over insignificant or imaginary things. How useless and hopeless are we if we allow such foolishness to divide us? Do we mean so little to each other?"

Sure they have our eternal thanks and gratitude but that seems so little for those willing to give so much. 22 veterans commit suicide every day. that's a 50% higher rate than non-veteran civilians. 20% of recent vets are diagnosed with PTSD. 30% have some form of mental health disorder. 20% become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 50K veterans are homeless on any given night. They were willing to give far more for our society than we appear willing to give to them. Maybe we should be doing more for our veterans than thanking them and maybe we should be doing it more than once a year.I'd like to hear suggestions. What do you think is the right way to treat our veterans?"

This is why New Orleans has zero homeless veterans, this is why we pass the plate, this is why we have St. Judes and toys for tots and coats for kids canned food drives and school supply donations.

Unsheltered homeless veterans decreased in number by between 30-50% over the last four years. New Orleans, Salt Lake, and Phoenix have already reached functional zero homeless veterans and Houston thinks it will be close by years end. The departments of Housing and Urban Development, Veteran Affairs, and Labor created a joint program called HUD-VASH which partners with cities to contact potentially homeless veterans, find a home for them, provide them with vouchers to pay for it, give them access to any VA medical, counseling, or other services they need and job training if needed within days of locating the veteran. A lot of red tape had to be cut for this to work (agency laws were rewritten) and I think 100% of the money is coming from the executive discretionary budget but it appears to be working. It's not unreasonable to think we can and will reach functionally zero homeless veterans in every American city in the next few years. It'll be a proud day for America when we can send veteran homelessness to the dustbin of history and that day, finally, appears to be coming.\n\nIf you know a homeless veterans look into this HUD - VASH thing. \n\nWhen we work together we can do great things but we can also do good things."

It's been a neglected rental for a while but there may be enough value in the price to make it a good investment for someone who wants to live there.You can probably also more than cover a mortgage note by using it as an Air BNB, waiting for upper lawrenceville to gentrify some more than selling it at a 5 figure profit."

That's a long time and far longer then his successor King Salman  (79 and sick) or now Crown Prince Murqin are likely to rule. Over their reigns the new king and crown prince will face some significant challenges. Iran is a bitter and possibly powerful enemy. The Saudis have an Al-Queda problem they're fighting in Yemen. Their human rights record is bad but improving. And, perhaps biggest of all, oil consumption may decline before Murqin passes the torch to the as of yet unnamed second in line. I've been paying attention mainly because Saudi Arabia has been able to flood the oil market thus crippling the economies of Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Thomas Scarlato. Is this power play related to the Saudi succession and will the new king keep up production? Interesting times in the oil world."

The Ruble:USD rate went from 64/$ to 82/$ (it was 34/$ 18 months ago), Iran finally capitulated to surrendering its nuclear program to ease economic sanctions (which may or may not be related to the decline of oil revenue), Venezuela is in hyper inflation and has probably destroyed its currency altogether (it's hard to be communist when 90% of your revenue came from no longer profitable oil), and my industry has completely disappeared thus forcing my economy to retool into an as of yet undecided sector."

At the time the military was seen as independent, professional, and effective so this wasn't a coup but rather a theoretically peacefulish transition of power. The military did what it swore it would and held relatively free and fair elections in May of 2012. The winner was Mohammad Morsi of the Freedom and Justice party which is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Morsi then annulled the limits on presidential power the military decreed before the election. He also asked for the resignation of the heads of the military and promoted Abdel Fattah al-Sisi from the head of Military Intelligence to supreme commander and later decreed that his decrees were not legally challengeable (but only until a new constitution would pass, of course). Folks didn't care for that and there were large scale riots. On July 1, 2013 the military issued an ultimatum that the political parties had 48 hours to meet the demands of the people or the military would. That day every minister (like a US cabinet post) not in the Muslim Brotherhood resigned. The next day Morsi rejected the 48 hour ultimatum. The day after the military removed Morsi and announced the head of the Constitutional Court Adly Mansour as the interim president. But folks don't like coup d'etat against their democratically elected president either so the protests continued. The military handled them militarily and killed a lot of protestors (638 killed 4k wounded ). Again the military delivered quick elections in May of 2014 but dispensed with that free and fair nonsense. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi resigned from the military to run, faced one opponent, and won with 96% of the vote. His term ends in 2018 and he can seek reelection only once. In theory. While Sisi isn't great for democracy he might not be terrible for Egypt right now. If he can stabilize the country and keep ISIS out and give up power in legitimate elections (and it looks like he's on pace there) then he could perhaps be an Abraham Lincoln like figure for Egypt. Of course he could also turn into yet another brutal dictator. Also, in May of 2015 Morsi and 105 of his friends were sentenced to death for inciting violence. Their sentences have been upheld but they're not dead yet. Probably."

This result can be directly attributed to Deborah Scarlato and the Diversity Committee.  Without Deborah having brought the issue of creating a name change policy for transgender students last year and without the support of the Diversity Committee last year, this simply wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have happened as smoothly as it did.  I suspect that it would have happened in a much more clunky way this year, when the above-referenced student expressed their wish to change their name and gender marker.  We would have stumbled this year, as we went forward, forward and might have managed the circumstance either as a one-time exception or perhaps even thought to create a policy.  Deborah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thinking ahead and the Diversity Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to help write help get implemented a policy allowed not only this student, but future similarly situated students to have a much easier time and allows them the right to access something normal that already exists, instead of merely requesting for a special exception to be made.  This is just one example of how our efforts make a difference in the lives of the institution, including, most importantly, its students.\""

He later started AEP (American Energy Partners) which also became a major energy player. This guy made and lost and made billions of dollars more than once. He was so important in the fracking boom and ensuing energy geopolitical landscape that you couldn't make a film about the boom without mentioning him. He was also my go to example of a guy who would do things which might technically legal but are probably not within the spirit of the law. Yesterday he was indicted by the department of justice for rigging the prices of auctions for oil and gas rights. He denied the charges. Today his SUV drove into an overpass at a high rate of speed killing him instantly before his Tahoe caught fire. (Cue the conspiracy theories)\n\nIt's hard for me to understand the highs and lows in a life like his. I, and basically all of my former colleagues, owe their careers (certainly the pay checks) to the Aubrey McClendons of the world. I still believe the fracking boom was and will be good for America. Although I've always considered McClendon to be ethically shady I am sad that he's died. I think he held a place in my mind similar to that of an Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller: a titan of industry, a shameless profiteer, and a devotee of the capitalist idea that what's good for business is good for America. Perhaps I've over romanticized the risk taker but McClendon was an incarnation of the American dream like an overly profitable cowboy."

This is how we get 8 years of the Jindal disaster and this is why they ran David Vitter for governor forcing LA to elect a Democrat. Until we come out and vote in large numbers in the primaries the GOP will continue to abuse the state. The act of voting in primaries is hugely important. Also, your vote matters. Every two-ish % of the vote awards a delegate. Give yours to the person you want to have them out keep them away from the person your don't. Either way your vote today carries a lot of weight as both the act of standing up for Louisiana and in determining the GOP nominee. For the Democrats it's much less important but y'all should vote too."

Push the \"Run\" button to watch the magic. The text in green after the // is my explanation of what each line does. You'll notice it because it looks like English and is far wordier than is probably necessary. The code is the not green stuff that does not look like English. It's technically c# (which is the language the class taught).\n\nhttps://repl.it/Bvpa/3\n\nThanks @[429018:2048:Katherine Karaus] for showing me this site."

They're called Schnapszahl birthdays which means something like clever number so you're supposed to be unusually clever this year. At least, that's what they told me in Dresden when I turned 22.\n\nAnd technically it's birthdays that are just one number repeated 22,33,55 rather than divisible by 11 because 111 would be particularly clever but 121 might not be despite being divisible by 11. Generally this isn't a major consideration because 110 year olds don't seem to notice the lack of expected cleverness due to a birthday divisible by 11. I presume they notice it in their 111th year but have maybe lost count by then. But I want you to be prepared that in 77 years the Germans won't consider your b-day to be clever for another year."

If any party candidate polls at 15% or better they will be included in the presidential debates. There are only three parties whose nominees will be on all 50 ballots in November: Democrat, Republican, Libertarian. Gary Johnson, the presumptive libertarian nominee polled at 11% in the most recent poll to include him and that's significant given that nobody has ever heard of him. If you feel like your party is shoving a candidate down your throat or that a candidate has been shoved down theirs send a third up on stage with them. There is nothing the party chairs want less than for their voters to have another option. I don't think Governor Johnson is even close to an ideal candidate but he would be the only person at the debates who thinks bombing the hell out of people is wrong. I think we need that view in our presidential debates and we need to remind the two main parties that we have other options for President and will not blindly vote for the D or R. \n\nThere are probably better candidates for President but the only one who is even close to the 15% threshold is Gary Johnson. So if you were in the #neverTrump camp or the Hillary version, consider voting for Gary Johnson. It'll get our point across."

If you look closely there is a baby Thomas in this picture as well as the baby version of many of my friends (most of whom I haven't seen in far too long). We sang at the Lorraine American Cemetery in St. Avold France where 10,000+ American dead from WW2 are buried. We sang a WW1 song which seemed fitting because the dead may have known that song in life but probably not any of the songs written to remember WW2. It was surreal singing about \"crosses row on row\" from the great war to end all wars to the crosses row on row from the next war while the US was once again at war. It felt like we'd betrayed the WW1 dead and the WW2 dead in front of us that we still haven't managed to put an end to warfare. We should probably get on that."

Shreveport/Bossier/NWLA is one of the participating communities and have made significant strides toward functional zero (meaning the community can house more homeless veterans each month than veterans become homeless each month thus no veterans are homeless unless they choose to be). Tomorrow I'll check with whomever is running the program in NWLA to see what the rest of us can do to help."

One example is that failing a background check is almost always a crime (attempting to purchase a gun while having whatever background failed the check). But these people are almost never prosecuted. In 2012 there were 150k such failures. \n\nSuppose the federal government decided to enforce this law and arrests basically everyone who has failed a background check in the last ten years. Would it be good if the ATF/FBI/ whomever arrested 1M+ folks who tried and failed to buy a gun over the next few weeks? That wouldn't require a new law just a bunch of money to enforce an existing one. Would responsible gun owners cheer the enforcement of the law or see this as the \"coming for our guns\" that many fear?\n\nIn his address today the president mentioned that the ATF is underfunded. What if we tweaked the law so that you pay for the gun then if you fail the background check you lose the money and the ATF uses it to arrest you?"

Initially this passes eyeball test in that most folks agree that people convicted of domestic violence should not own guns but this creates some interesting edge cases.\n\nIn his dissent Justice Thomas noted that, according to this ruling, a person can be stripped of a constitutional right for life as a result of a crime so minor they don't even have the right to a jury trial. It's an extreme edge case and the first time that happens there will be appeals and this will almost certainly be settled in a more sensible manner because our justice system is fairly robust and self correcting but as of now a person can legally lose a constitutional right without the right to a trial. It's a good example of how well meaning and desirable legislation can also create unintended and deeply undesirable outcomes."

So the people protest. They march. They chant. They make it abundantly clear that bad policing is not safe, not effective, and no longer acceptable. Which, I suspect, is what the good cops would shout from the rooftops if they felt like they had a voice. \n\nThe two sides to this are protestors, good cops, and the need for reform on the one side against bad cops and the stagnant institutions that allow bad policing to continue on the other."

There are entire cities and parishes where the majority of residents have lost their homes. Its \"once in 100 years\" flooding and some areas have flooded beyond what was previously considered possible. \n\nAre y'all hearing this outside the state? Is this even a thing for the rest of the country?\n\nFrom my friend Ann: yo. baton rouge is part of america. it is even a state capital. like, of one of the united states. of america. also part of america: st. amant. denham springs. prairieville. these happen to be cities and towns that my friends and family actually live in. in the state of louisiana, which is part of the united states of america. my friend's sister was rescued by boat off of I-12. my great-aunt and uncle were rescued by boat from their home. between 20-30,000 people have been rescued from four parishes. those are what you would call counties in your part of the country. four counties' worth of flooding. four counties' worth of people now homeless. fucking pay attention. this is going to be a long recovery process that deserves a little bit of your give-a-shit.\n\nhttp://nyti.ms/2bl6C9O"

She thinks of herself as a person who found her way up from the bottom in Dever and is intensely proud of that and of her city. I think that pride is part of why it would mean so much if you visited. This is speculation but i think she wants you 3 to be proud of her i think she thinks you're not. If yall came up for her birthday or any time would mean a lot to her.\n\nI know getting to Denver is a pain in the ass and probably isnt a top vacation destination. I made the drive between two shifts at work. It would be pretty easy as a 2 day drive (i think a road trip with yall would be a blast). There are also shv to denver direct flights but theyre not cheap. And i also know how increadibly valuable your time is to your many worthy obligations. \n\nI also know that Im speaking out of turn and from a place of relative igorance. For that I apologize. But everytime I see her she speaks with great longing about how great it would be if you visited and I had to pass that along."

There are sacred bonds that we as Americans share and first among them is to take care of each other, especially the people we ask to sacrifice on our behalf. And we don't do that. It's one of the great unspoken shames of this nation. It's a complicated issue and there are some good things happening. But here is one little thing we can all do that would help tremendously: treat mental injuries like any other kind of injury.  20 veterans (down from 22) are committing suicide every day presumably as a result of mental injuries or illnesses.  \n\nGood people would never mock or make fun of the physically injured (certainly among veterans) and when we mock or make fun of \"crazy people\" or mentally ill or injured folk of any sort we make it harder for the people who may need help to get it. This particularly true of veterans who are especially, and rightfully,  proud of their toughness and independence. We all need to start treating a trip to the psychiatrist like a trip to the optometrist so our veterans who do need help will face no stigma and hopefully they get help like they do for every other injury they sustain on our behalf. We owe them vastly more but this, at least, we can each actually individually do."

The exit polls also had Hillary winning by a significant margin (FL by 1.3%, NC by 2.1%, PA by 4.4%, WI by 3.9%). International election monitors wouldn't certify an election with that level of discrepancy. And there is also the issue that enemies of the United States have been launching cyber attacks against the US to influence the election in Trumps favor.\n\nI don't think it is likely that the election was hacked or stolen in abnormal ways (I do think voter suppression likely played a huge role in denying people ballot access for political reasons). But it would be irresponsible not to re-count the ballots to ensure there have been no shenanigans. I also want to see them count the provisional ballots. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/23/jill-stein-election-recount-fund-michigan-wisconsin-pennsylvania"

        "post": "Fidel Castro died. His goals were wrong headed but he was brilliant about achieving them. He was able to resist a global superpower for decades with far more success than anyone expected. I think it would have been better for the Cuban people if he had been somewhat less successful but I can't deny his success. I't s instructive to look at the responses form President Obama and juxtapose it against that of Donald Trump. (I've included them below)\n\nTrumps statement probably makes Cuban Americans feel vindicated that Castro was a bad guy but it forces Cuba away from the US and back into it's communist fold. The Presidents statement gives room for the Cuban government to continue to actually make Cubans more free and move Cuba away from communism. It doesn't feel as good as calling someone out but it actually does the important thing. \n\nUnder President Obama the Cubans have made significant strides toward free market economies, improved human rights, and becoming a member of the \"free\" world for the firs time in 60 years. That only happens by creating avenues for progress rather than shutting them down by loudmouthing about their founding hero. When you disrespect a nation they will not be willing to work with you toward your goals. In claiming that Trump that his administration will finally put Cuba on the path to Freedom he has actually stunted the significant progress that President Raul Castro, President Obama, and Pope Francis have working toward down that path.\n\nWhat you say matters. When you're the President or presidential candidate it matters a lot. Trumps mouth has set back Cuban US relations and stunted Cubas move away from communism.\n\nThis is President Obamas response:\nAt this time of Fidel Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in Cuba and in the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.\nFor nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.\nToday, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.\n\nThis is Trumps response:\nToday, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.\nWhile Cuba remains totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.\nThough the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaigh, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba."

They'll even support white nationalists in part because they're the only ones not calling them racists. \n\nThis is interesting. It suggests that the word \"racist\" is so loaded and being a racist so abhorred that even folks who \"just hate n***ers\"  are unwilling to see themselves as such. It also means there are functionally very different meanings for the word. It could be the Avenue Q \"Everyone's a little bit racist sometimes\" to whatever white nationalists think it means that somehow doesn't include them. This also suggests I'm so out of touch with that wing of the right that I don't know what they think it means. \n\nAny of my friends who are commonly referred to as racist but think they're not what do you think makes a person racist?\n\nAnd to my lefty friends, I ask for some understanding on this issue. I have several friends who \"Don't hate black people, I just hate n***ers\". And that stance represents significant inter-generational progress. Their fathers wouldn't have given any black people a chance just on skin color alone. At least this generation is willing to interact with black people and that's no small thing. While some progressives may fight at the family table about pronouns, some conservatives have to fight at the family table about the humanity of non-whites. It takes enormous personal strength and character for a conservative to stand up to their overtly racist parents and say \"You're wrong, some black people are okay\". This may not be a fight you know but it is bloody and painful so lets not marginalize their efforts. It's not easier just because they're a generation or two behind. It's probably harder because hatred has roots and while racism may be a theoretical construct in lily white leftisttown it's woven into the fabric of life in the conservative south. It's absolutely not okay but it may be a step forward from the place they started. Being able to openly talk about it would be another."

This is nothing new from this Administration, since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office.\n\nFor more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. The Corps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 review process and its decisions have been ratified by two federal courts. The Army Corps confirmed this again today when it stated its \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolicy decision\u00e2\u0080\u009d does \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot alter the Army\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position that the Corps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline.\n\nThe White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency.\n\nAs stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way."

In order to use this process they have to make the change budget neutral (or better) which mean they have to cut the expenditures without cutting the income so the net effect is the worst of both worlds. It'll also reduce the votes needed for full repeal which not only circumvents the filibuster but it also allows the GOP to repeal without even a GOP consensus. Right now there are a handful on GOP congressmen who support repeal and replace but not full repeal or repeal then - at some undetermined later date - replace. \n\nThe biggest issue for the GOP is the timing. House members want to repeal before their next election in 2 years. Senators want to wait until after the 2020 election because they know what happens to a party when they kick 22m people off of their health insurance. Most republicans want to keep provisions like expanded medicaid, staying on parents insurance to 26, and no denials for pre-existing conditions (because they're not monsters). But that will take a grand debate and bargain among the GOP to get the timing, budget, and regulation in order (as it should) but they don't have a viable alternative yet and its been 6 years. \n\nThe danger with this process is that'll make it so a moment of political necessity (an election/scandal/whatever) could result in a ham fisted full repeal and cost 22m people their insurance. If they do without a viable replacement people who are truly sick, or injured, or have on expensive medication might never be able to get insurance again. Insurance don't take pre-existing conditions unless the law says they have to.  \n\nThis is like taking the safety off of a loaded gun pointing it in the general direction of millions of Americans and saying \"don't worry, we'll figure out what we're shooting at later but we don't think it'll be you\"."

Once the Nazis destroyed the Poish army they repurposed it into a labor camp in which the value of the lives of the prisioners was zero. Mostly people worked and every day some people died / were murdered. Auschwitz was also home to many \"medical experiments\" involving children and twins in particular. Even without Birkenau this would be one of the worst places in the entirely of human existence. But Birkenau was much worse.\n\nBirkenau was a purpose built labor and death camp in which the value of human life was negative. 5-20% of each group of prisoners sent to Birkenau were selected to enter the labout camp where the average life span was 3 months. The rest were sent to the gas chambers where the average life span was 20min plus however long the line was. More than a million people were murdered here. Nobody know exactly how many. The Nazis didn't inprocess people going straight to the gas chambers. \n\nThe beds on the right were from a womens room. 5 women would sleep on each of the three levels generally on their sides and the folks ont he bottom generally slept in mud. Also the bathroom facilities were useless so the human waste built up and trickled down to those on the bottom. The average lifespan on the bottom was much lower than  months. \n\nBoth sets of beds were among the nicer ones for prisoners as their buldings were brick. Most were wooden structures that have seen been destroyed."

Where the trains got half way down the track (the picture ont he bottom right) the prisoners were off loaded and seperated into two groups: people for work and people for the gas chambers. This is last place people selected to work ever saw their families who would be dead soon. \n\nThe people who were sent to Auschwitz and  Birkenau were told that they were being re-settled in Eastern Europe and this was a transit point. They were told to bring the belongings they would need to start over in their new homes. The tower on the lower left is interesting in that it's not a defensible structure. That tower only functions if the people receiving orders from it are expected to be compliant.That was part of the lie. When people were off loaded they were told to mark their bags, then go have a shower and de-lousing at the end of the track, at which point they'll be reuinted with their bags and in-processed. The showers were gas chambers. This was mass murder on an industrial scale and it was efficient. \n\nIt was striking how short that journey is from the gate to the gas chambers. We walked the distance twice just in our tour of the area."

Empty cans of Zyklon B.\n\nZyklon B was a cyanide based pesticide used for de-lousing clothes. The US used it heavily prior to the war. The Nazis realized it would be effective as a poison gas when one Nazi was experimenting on Soviet POWs in a basement and discovered that in a closed area it only took a few min for the prisoners to die. They quickly discovered that the place of execution needed to be close to the method of corpse disposal and thus was created the gas chamber / crematorium combination which would kill millions of people.\n\nMany thosands of people were killed in the room photographed.

One example is that failing a background check is almost always a crime (attempting to purchase a gun while having whatever background failed the check). But these people are almost never prosecuted. In 2012 there were 150k such failures. \n\nSuppose the federal government decided to enforce this law and arrests basically everyone who has failed a background check in the last ten years. Would it be good if the ATF/FBI/ whomever arrested 1M+ folks who tried and failed to buy a gun over the next few weeks? That wouldn't require a new law just a bunch of money to enforce an existing one. Would responsible gun owners cheer the enforcement of the law or see this as the \"coming for our guns\" that many fear?\n\nIn his address today the president mentioned that the ATF is underfunded. What if we tweaked the law so that you pay for the gun then if you fail the background check you lose the money and the ATF uses it to arrest you?"

So much so that the Sheriff suggested he might not write tickets if all the money goes to the DA. When crime is a revenue source there is no incentive to reduce it. \n\nThis isn't even the most egregious source of profiting from crime in the state. The private prison system is much worse. But peek behind this curtain and see why police write speeding tickets instead of actually serving and protecting their communities. I should note that DeSoto isn't even one of the states worst speed traps (West Baton Rouge, Point Coupee, and St Landry are the worst of which I am aware).\n\nI have a revolutionary idea: lets pay 911 people (police, fire, ambulance) and their associated systems with tax dollars instead of fees and fines so they can focus on their important work instead of revenue generation."

Folks who have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet work far more than 40 hours don't get weekends or holidays or time and half OT. Many of them also don't enjoy any full time benefits despite working more than 40 hours per week. \n\nThe gains of labor have been largely reversing. This is why wages are stagnant, people are having a harder time paying bills but Wall Street is seeing record highs. This is why for the first time ever the next generation is expected to be worse off than the prior one. This is why life expectancy is declining. This is why people are looking for someone else to blame. This is why working class Americans are turning on each other. \n\nWe're all working harder than ever and getting less for it.

After a party another friend and I who, at the time, were much more successful with women than he was (again, this long long ago in a time far far away) sat down with him and told him that the handsyness wasn't cool and wasn't never going to work for him anyway. Then we took him to the local bar to drink the butthurt away and to get girls numbers while the other gave commentary. \n\nSpecifically, I remember telling him to observe how the other friend always stays a step away from the person he's interested in because the space sets her at ease, give him a more commanding presence, belies any sense of desperation, and, most importantly, gives her a chance to come to him. If she's interested she'll take the step and move things along in the first few minutes and if she isn't you save face, save time, and don't come off as a desperate creep. \n\nAt the next few parties this friend was not handsy and had a much better posture. Shortly thereafter he had a series of increasingly better relationships and is, I think, in life partner territory now. He's happy. She's happy. Our female friends are happy. \n\nThe moral of the story is a) give people their space and b) if you have a friend who is a bit of a creep you're not doing them any favors by not confronting them about it (and you're selling out all of your female friends to your cowardice if you don't). \n\nAlso, if you ever see or hear about me being creepy or worse I want you to tell me about it. \n\nChristopher H. McLain sat me down a decade ago and explained what an emotional affair was and that if a woman is confiding in me things she's not telling her husband then I may be creating a wedge in their marriage even if I'm a good dude, friends with them both, and mean well. Since then I've tried to treat a person, their partner, and their marriage as 3 distinct things. Although I may be good for the person and for their partner I try to consider if I'm also good for their relationship. This hasn't been overwhelmingly effective but at least I'm aware of the issue.\n\nBro chats work. Have them."

He's also the second GOP member of the Foreign Relations committee (with the chair Bob Corker) to defect. He also changes the balance of the Judiciary committee to anti Trump if you include Lindsay Graham (who openly despises Trump).  \n\nIf he holds to this statement (which can never be counted on from politicians) then today is a the biggest blow to Trumpism thus far. I'm torn between being relieved that Trump can not be more easily opposed and being worried that the defections are coming from the most important and best informed committees in government. \n\nLets hope McCain, Corker, and Flake do the work rather than simply taking the praise.\n\nAlso, the speech is pretty good if a bit long (17 min).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uVk0KdPLpc"

        "post": "I read up on the Uranium One Hillary Clinton kerfuffle and I'd like to add my two cents as a person who has worked on ,large energy resource transfer projects that included a significant uranium component in Wyoming (the state where the sold mine was located). \n\nSpecifically, I think folks misunderstand the value of owning mineral resources in another country and the oversight process in place for energy extraction, transport, and export.\n\nFor those who don't know what the Uranium One kerfuffle is all about here is a two sentence summary. Uranium One, a Canadian company, sold large US uranium mines to Russia while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. The allegation is that she made this happen in exchange for large donations to the Clinton Foundation from uranium investors. Spoiler Alert: This is makes no sense upon closer inspection. \n\nFirstly, these sales aren't unusual. We routinely sell mineral assets to foreign nations. China owns a ton of our natural gas reserves. The foreign nations buy it as a hedge against increasing energy prices (if the cost of the mineral goes up so does their profit from their resource). They're not buying this energy to use it or keep in their strategic reserve because they don't have access to it. If push came to shove it's not like the US would ever allow a foreign nation to mine resources on US soil to use against us even if that nation owned the resource. No matter who owns the resource the government regulates production, transport, and export the same. So owning a uranium mine doesn't give Russia any more access to uranium exports. Uranium is really only marketable for power plants Also, Kazakhstan exports more uranium than we do and if Putin wanted to own a resource he could actually exploit for the mineral (rather than a financial hedge) he would just buy in Kazakhstan. And he might have done that. I don't know anything about their industry.\n\nSecond, the amount of regulation on production, transport, and export of uranium (or any energy resource really) is extremely onerous.For example, in order to transport a certain type of crude the train cars are required to have different construction materials and techniques due to federal regulation. Every step is heavily regulated and overseen by multiple agencies at both the state and federal level. Remember the Dakota Access Pipeline and the permit issues? Remember the Keystone XL pipeline? And those are small regulatory hurdles compared to nuclear energy concerns in the US. Obama approved two nuclear plants in Georgia in 2010 (which have been smothered in regulations) and that's the first time since 77 that a new nuclear power plant was approved. The regulations are immense. There just isn't a scenario in which energy can just be exported under the table. That basically can't happen. In addition to onerous regulation of production and export there are multiple non-partisan review panels for the sale of major assets like the Uranium One sale. So I don't think it's plausible that Clinton could have gotten the deal passed the regulatory panels (particularly the ones in Wyoming where she is despised) if it would not have otherwise passed. As Secretary of State it's possible she could have cleared it through a sanctions issue and the job does involve promoting foreign direct investment in the US but that's just normal day to day function of the State Department.\n\nLastly, the donations don't seem connected to the sale (which also seems unconnected to Clinton). People who believe in the Al Gore vision of our energy future would naturally invest in both nuclear energy and the Clinton Global Initiative on climate change. It's investing in cap and trade or carbon taxes which is probably not a bad long term investment. I also think if you look deeper into the donations you'll find that the allegations don't hold up but this isn't my area of expertise. \n\nSo yeah, this Uranium One deal seems perfectly normal. These deals happen all the time. This isn't a nefarious deal. It isn't a particularly good deal for Russia. And it makes no sense that bribing a Clinton would be involved in any way. Some players in the energy industry are shady and we are all right to be suspicious about their safety, financial, and environmental records but nothing about this seems off at all."

        "post": "Our \"ally\" Saudi Arabia underwent a dramatic power shift last night as recently appointed 32 year old crown prince Muhammad bin Salman had 11 other princes arrested including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who many consider to the the best businessman in the country and dozens of other highly placed officials. (They're being held at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh because prince prison apparently has 5 stars.) Saudi Arabia has also declared a full blockade on Yemen against whom they've been at war and within which they've caused a famine that is currently starving 7m people. They attempted a less militaristic blockade against Qatar earlier this year but it hasn't been as successful. The most important US airbase in the region is in Qatar and that is certainly a factor in any Saudi consideration of the use of force against Qatar.\n\nToday the prime minister of Lebanon Saad al-Hariri, a Saudi / Lebanese dual citizen whose billion dollar fortune is based on his Saudi construction firm, abruptly resigned while in Riyadh. According to the Saudis al-Hariri told them that the Hezbollah group in Lebanon which may be in power now (that situation is very unclear as this happened today) has declared war on Saudi Arabia. So the Saudis are claiming that Lebanon has declared war on them. (Presumably as a pre-text to go to war with Lebanon)\n\nHezbollah (and the Houthi in Yemen) are believed to have Iranian backing and these are essentially Saudi-Iranian proxy wars. However, Hezbollah was operating as a peaceful (ish) legitimate political party who participated in government and hates Israel. Israel hates them back and both been preparing for a war with Hezbollah at some point. That point may well be nowish. Israel could easily defeat all of Lebanon in a military conflict but Hezbollah is believed to have thousands of missiles capable of hitting major Israeli cities so a war will have high civilian casualties for Israel (and probably Lebanon). \n\nThe Saudis are expected to use Israeli as a corridor to attack and it's possible the Saudi position that Lebanon has declared war on them may be an attempt to keep Israel out of the fight (or at least to prevent Hezbollah from firing their missiles at Israel since they'll need them for the Saudis). \n\nWhat would the US do? If Israeli cities are attacked with a barrage from Hezbollah it seems impossible that the US would stay out of it. The Trump administration is very anti-Iran and close to the Saudi branch that initiated the purge 4 paragraphs ago. I don't think anyone wants another war in the middle east but that certainly seems to be in the works. Russia is also much closer to Iran than Saudi Arabia so it could be a proxy war among our proxies. Syria is also potentially in play as neither the Saudis nor Israelis care for al-Assad.\n\nThe humanitarian fallout would be immense. Lebanon has been stellar in regards to the Syrian refugee crisis (still very much a major global concern). 25% of the people in Lebanon are Syrian refugees and a war there would obviously force them, as well as millions of Lebanese, elsewhere. Obviously the loss of human life in the conflict would be very high. It will likely create a power vacuum from which all manner of extremism can flourish (see: ISIS). And that is in addition to the Saudi led humanitarian nightmare in Yemen. \n\nHopefully this will all simmer down somehow and if we had a functional state department we could perhaps de-escalate the situation as we have in years past. We should all hope that it doesn't come to war and if it does that it'll be the swift and relatively painless sort but more likely it'll be brutal and the US will end up directly involved."

I don't think I accomplished anything between veterans day 2016 and 2017 that actually helped veterans. \n\nI'm guessing most folks are in the same well meaning but practically useless place. There is plenty to do: Every day 20ish veterans commit suicide and 40K are homeless. And I think we - you and me and really anyone - can actually make real and meaningful differences here. (if it were everyone this would be solved) \n\nI'm also guessing that someone here also knows a good way that we can actually do something between this veteran day and next which would actually make life better for the 1.4M veterans in need. \n\nSo, how do you help? How should I? What programs should I look into working with? Bill Peduto, Is Pittsburgh still working on the  Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness? If so, how can I help?"

        "post": "My thoughts on the Doug Jones election:\n\n1) The victory belongs to black Alabamians.They turned out like it was 08 Obama and won this election almost entirely by themselves. The Democratic party hasn't earned this. Too often southern black people - particularly  in rural areas - are treated like a means to an end during election season and ignored entirely when it's time to legislate by the Democrats. The black belt of Alabama gave us the civil rights act and somehow the rest of us act like we gave the civil rights act to them. We're never going to be great again until southern blacks are full and equal participants in our society. We're a long way from it and they deserve better. So do the rest of us.\n\n2) The women who spoke out against Roy Moore are heroic. I don't know this but I'm guessing their lives have been much harder since speaking out. They've had to re-live the assault from Moore in front of the entire country only to be called liars by many of their neighbors and elected officials. Roy Moore is a monster and if his public life is over it'll be because these women killed him and for that we should all thank them. \n\n3) I thought after Jon Bel Edwards (d) beat David Vitter (R) for the Louisiana governor the GOP would  realize the south is too proud to vote for a monster in republican clothing. But then they voted for Trump who is absolutely a monster so I'm glad to get another data point suggesting southern people, my people, aren't going to vote for monsters.\n\n4) The southern black church is the bulwark of American decency while the white evangelical church needs to do some soul searching by that I mean they need to figure out where they lost it because it's been gone for a while now. I hope the American community of faith can follow leaders like Rev William Barber III and abandon the likes of Franklin Graham. If the church is going to be a thing in America in a generation - and I hope that it is - they need to end this Faustian bargain with the GOP.\n\n5) Governor Kay Ivy clarified an old law designed to disenfranchise black voters in such a way as to re-enfranchise people who have been convicted of low level felonies like drug possession. 144,000 voters were able to vote for the first time in this election for the first time. America shouldn't be denying the right to vote to any citizen unless they're convicted of treason. We should be doing everything we can to increase the number of people who vote in our elections and the folks who work both thanklessly and tirelessly to restore the rights of these Americans are making a huge difference. 1.6M people in Florida have been stripped of the vote. Here is a group trying to fix that: https://florida.ourstates.org/\n\n6) If the Alabama GOP is looking for new leadership (hint: they should be) I suggest looking to folks who put country over party and voted for Doug Jones. Y'all need folk who have a moral compass and a spine. Disgraced former governor Bentley appointed then AG Luther Strange to the senate while he was being investigated by Strange. That's not the act of a man with morals. Neither is accepting such an arrangement. Roy Moore was a monster but the Alabama GOP establishment isn't much better.\n\n7) If you're a good decent person and a strong candidate thinking about running for office in an election that is historically opposed to your views you should run. There should be republicans running in NYC and democrats running in Alabama. Obviously, victory is possible in any situation. Those unopposed ballots are what make the extreme candidates like Roy Moore possible. We should be running Democratic Socialists, Libertarians, and everyone in between."

I know I'd much rather have more time with my family than literally anything anyone can afford to buy me.\n\nSanta's \"naughty or nice\" list is particularly insidious. It sets up Christmas morning as a definitional moment for children. If you're good/nice you'll have more/better presents from Santa. If you have few or no presents it must be because you're naughty / bad. Of course, the truth is that the number and quality of presents a child gets only measures the wealth of their parent(s). But kids don't get that. They just see that the kids with wealthier family are on Santa's nice list while kids with poor families are not. This is the only time a child is judged by an all seeing all knowing entity and that judgment is basically wealthy = nice while poor = naughty.\n\nOf course poor parents know this and feel tremendous pressure to spend what little money they have on children's toys, rather than a more important purchase. If they're lucky, they may be able to work more hours to pay for it thus denying them the time to spend with their kids because they're forced to spend money on them instead."

Tragically, he's also the president which gives weight to his idiocy. If you can, simply ignore them man. I, unfortunately, can not.\n\nOn shitholes: A shithole is a place that you probably don't know much about and would not expect to be comfortable. In our media non-white places are usually portrayed as shit holes. Nobody reports good news from non-white countries (except maybe Japan) and Hollywood rarely portrays non-white cultures honestly. In this ignorance some Americans think of those places as shit holes. This is both false and nakedly racist but it's true that many Americans think that way. We have a racism problem and a geographic ignorance problem both of which our current president is exacerbating. \n\nIf Trump thinks your country is a shit hole it means he doesn't know much about your country (he doesn't seem to know much about mine either) and that he doesn't think he'd be comfortable there.  Trump not feeling comfortable in your country is a good thing. The man is only comfortable around authoritarians, oligarchs, and white supremacists. That he likes Norway should give Norwegians pause about what Trump thinks about their society far more so than any country he insults."

What's an honest representation of the city?\n\nI think I can convince them to spend not more than one day in the quarter and most of that on Frenchman st. The woman who is going tomorrow is into hiking, art, photography, nature, culture, and is extraordinarily playful. So I think I'm going to recommend City Park (and the sculpture garden), Armstrong park, and a cemetery for a long hiking day. But as for neighborhoods I don't know what gentrification has done to what over the years. 5 years ago I was a fan of bywater and the 9th ward but I'd appreciate advice on this. I know things have happened but I don't know what. \n\nAlso, pgh folk not going to be afraid of the cold though surely they hope for warmth.\n\nSo yeah, what's the best current advice for people checking out New Orleans that will convince them to come back?\n\nAlso, I miss y'all.

In it the players are all villains trying to flee a planet slated for destruction but, being villains, have very limited options of places to which to flee. It's a real time social deduction and set collection game that plays in about 5 min and is actually kinda fun. @[2258636:2048:Jeff], @[500777052:2048:Kaitlyn], and I  were the main designers but there were lots of folks who contributed really good ideas and playtested. @[636880161:2048:Cynthia] created the original art. \n\nMaking a game is much harder than I thought it would be. The print ant play for the prototype is available here. I expect that we'll update it after some more play tests so this is probably not the finished product. But it's playable and it's fun.\n\nhttps://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/abandon-planet"

Board games can, but generally don't, help create empathy for and understand the decision making of people who live different lives. Once they do I think they will have crossed a threshold into important art.\n\nWhile board game designers and their games are often brilliant they are also extraordinarily homogeneous. So far as I know, nearly all successful board game designers are cis straight white middle aged able bodied middle class men from developed nations. Nobody can tell an authentic story about a life they don't know so we don't have board games about managing life with chronic illness, or American poverty, or life in Syria (or West Shreveport, or prison, or Sudan or Bangladesh) or the challenges faced by women, poor people, trans people, handicapped people, single parents, migrant workers, black people, poly people, or really any minority or oppressed people.\n\nOur society lacks empathy for and understand of how other people live. While facing decisions in a board game is in no way the same as making those choices and feeling their consequences in actual life, anything which can help us be better neighbors is a thing worth pursuing."

It's pretty well documented that the news coverage and discussions that follow suicides, terrorist attacks, and other major trauma events can cause a spike in that form of behavior. The CDC has issued guidelines on how to cover these events that reduce the likelihood of them spreading. Basically, don't glorify the killer (even in suicide), don't over simplify the motives, don't give how to level details of the event, don't play the event on loop (move on to the aftermath rather than being stuck on the same images and scenes), don't present the event as a means to an end, and don't focus on the positive aspects of the killer (even in suicide). This is one of the reasons that suicide is vastly under reported.  The media botched this hard after Robin Williams and the country experienced a 10% spike in suicides in the wake thereof. It's tragic that this happens so often that we're good at it now but I'm glad that we're good at it.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031539.htm\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-robin-williams-suicides/robin-williams-death-linked-to-rise-in-copycat-suicides-idUSKBN1FR3AW"

Andrew McCabe could have earned 7 figures / year working in the private sector but instead he served us for far less. \n\nHow are we going to convince the next round brilliant legal minds that service is the right life choice when we can't even promise financial secure retirements to people with multi-million dollar skill sets who served with distinction for decades? It's the same at State. \n\nThe people who actually keep us safe as a nation are the career employees of the DOJ, DHS, and State Department. It's a major problem that we're losing folks in mass but our inability to recruit replacements is a major threat to the security and stability of the nation.

        "post": "The March for Our Lives folks put forward concrete policy suggestions that they believe will save lives. I'm shocked how conservative they are. The first three aren't even controversial in gun owner circles. The last two are polling around 50/50 among gun owners. These recommendations could have come from any responsible gun owners organization (which does not include the NRA). There is no seizing of weapons. There is no mention of ammunition availability. There is no mention of preventing groups of people from buying guns. There is no mention of open or concealed carry restrictions. No mention of reciprocity. They're just: study the issue, enforce and improve existing laws, and ban the production and sale of the most dangerous tools of mass shooters.\n\nI've included each policy proposal below along with my immediate thoughts on them.\n\n1) Let the CDC study gun violence and fund the research. \n--- I think it's a scandal that the CDC was barred from studying gun violence. The new spending bill likely rectifies that but doesn't provide any funding to actually do the research. This seems like an obvious no-brainer. People are dying. We don't have good answers. At least this way we can start looking for them in a serious way.\n\n2) Eliminate restrictions and modernize the ATF. \n--This is so obvious that every gun owner I've spoken with supports effective enforcement of the laws already on the books. It's possible our laws would be effective if the enforcement agency weren't catastrophically hamstrung. (personally, I don't care for the ATF but they're the people who enforce gun regulations and  the job is too important to not be done)\n\n3) Mandate universal background checks.\n-- I presume they mean every time a gun is sold no matter the circumstances of the sale. I would go further and include every time a gun changes ownership for any reason. In some states this is effectively already the law. But background checks is one of those areas in which underfunding and hamstringing the ATF has undercut the law. Most people who fail background checks do so because it's illegal for them to attempt to purchase a gun. In theory the ATF should arrest and charge most people who fail background checks. Doing so would put real teeth in the background check system and is just enforcing the laws on the books already.\n\n4) Ban magazines with capacity greater than 10 rounds.\n-- I've played with high cap mags before and they're fun as hell to unload. I will miss the high-cap mag when it's gone but they're so dangerous that they probably should be regulated out of the hands f the general public. They're fun to shoot but they're made for mass shootings. That's why they exist. Eliminating these or requiring them to remain locked away in a licensed gun range won't stop mass shootings but it'll make it harder, more expensive, and easier to mess up. There is an argument about being able to resist the military if it came to that but we should have a moment of honesty here: unless we're going to have privately owned tanks, fighter jets, nuclear weapons, and heavy artillery then we can't effectively resist the military by force. There is no reason to think high cap mags are going to make any difference except that they're costing civilian lives in this time of peace. \n\n5) Ban future production or sale of assault weapons for civilian use and implement a buy back or registration program for the existing assault weapons. \n--They don't define assault weapons here except for \"weapons of war\". But I think it's safe to say this includes the AR-15 and other high powered semi-automatic rifles. I presume they don't include hunting rifles or shot guns or sport shooting rifles. I love shooting guns. Emptying a high capacity magazine through an assault rifle with my friends in the woods is a good time. I have fond memories and expect to do this again. That said, the difference between shooting assault rifles with high cap mags vs hunting or sport shooting rifles with low cap mags is pretty small. Yes, bigger is more fun but not by enough to justify how dangerous they are. By this plan we could still go out and shoot them they would just have to be registered and I would not be able to buy a new one. And really, if I could go to a shooting range and go shooting there with the rifles they own, maintain, and register then I, and I think most people who like to shoot, would feel no major loss here. That might actually be more fun if they had more expensive or fully automatic rifles. But like the high-cap mags these are designed to shoot people in mass. They're too dangerous to justify keeping them around because they're slightly more fun than shooting a rifle that is vastly less deadly. And, again, the resisting the military argument holds no water here either. \n\nI realize banning assault rifles is controversial and might violate the second amendment but we rightly ban military weapons of all kinds (nukes, nerve gas, machine guns, etc) because they're just too dangerous to be made publicly available. The assault rifle dramatically multiplies the legality of a individual so much that we should keep them off the streets like we do machine guns. \n\nThese suggestions won't stop gun violence (they might not even dent gun violence)  and they probably won't stop mass shootings. But they will make it harder for an individual to kill lots of people in very little time if we enact these changes. \n\nhttps://marchforourlives.com/how-we-save-lives/"

        "post": "Secretary of Defense Mattis has regular media availability. If you've never read them I would recommend reading the one linked below. It's from the 27th. But if you don't have the time I copied his comments about the Saudi war on Yemen and US involvement here. \n\nSome background on the Saudi-Yemini war. This isn't a war so much as it is a slaughter. Saudis claim the Iranian backed  Houthi are terrorists. They seem themselves as legitimate religious, tribal, and political entities. They're insurgents who acquired some power in what is left of the government of Yemen. Their legitimacy is debated. I have not seen evidence that they have engaged in terrorism but I would not likely see it if it exists. The Houthis do not have the forces threaten Saudi Arabia in any meaningful way in combat. They have some rockets they've been shooting into Saudi Arabia to little effect and have been somewhat effective in defensive ground fighting. The Saudis have overwhelming force and equipment but haven't been able to rout the Houthis. Think US vs Taliban for a combat level equivalent. The Houthis can't win but they might not lose.\n\nThe war has been an absolute horror story on the humanitarian front. The civilian casualties are very high though an accurate count is not possible, the government has essentially collapsed, there is a cholera epidemic which has killed thousands of people, and there is a famine brewing which will starve about 8m people. Another 11m are in a state of food crisis accoring to the UN. It is a disaster to such a degree that some consider it genocide.\n\nAnd the US is involved on the Saudi side. \n\nSpecifically, the US is involved with the arming, training, and planning missions on the Saudi side. \n\nI oppose this war and the US involvement in it but I wanted to paste Sec Mattis' comments here to show how complex the issue of US involvement is. Things I thought were notable from this exchange: The official recognition that we are involved with the planning of missions, How much less professional the Saudi military is than the US military (and how delicately Mattis explains that), and how we're trying to minimize the damage the less professional Saudi military creates while using US weapons. \n\n(Also, I'm not an expert. My facts or understanding here may be incorrect. It's obviously a controversial issue and the actual truth is hard to ascertain. If anyone notices any inaccuracies or unfair characterization in what I've said please mention it. I like to be as accurate as I can be.)\n\nSEC. MATTIS:  Yeah.  What the -- when you look at such things are air refueling -- when you're a pilot in the air and you've got bombs on your wing and you got somebody calling on you to drop and you're watching you fuel gauge go down, you say, \"No, you don't.  We're going to refuel you.  There's no need for a rash or hasty decision there.\"\n\nWhen we're doing the planning, we have shown them how you have what we call no-strike zones.  These are places where, because there are schools or hospitals -- but it's not as easy as just saying, \"Okay, there's a school or hospital; now, draw a circle around it on a map.\"  Now it's got to go up into the airplane.  Now the people who are calling for strikes have got to be aware.  Sometimes you add to them; you found a new place where you didn't have it on the map before.\n\nSo this is a very dynamic sort of battlefield management.\n\nWe have officers there that make certain that that is brought up and the process for bringing it right into the pilots and the decision-making has been proven by pilots saying \"Not gonna drop.  I don't think I can miss the no-strike area adjacent to that target.\"\n\nSo you see this sort of maturation.  Some of you have gotten very used to the U.S. military's ability to do this sort of thing, and we're not perfect about it.  But other countries, this is -- this is the trigonometry level of warfare.  And it -- so we're helping on that, as well.\n\nFull Transcript:\nhttps://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1477375/media-availability-with-secretary-mattis-at-the-pentagon/"

I wonder how similar my day today was - and maybe the rest of the month might be - to the early days of an opiate addiction. This reminds me that addicted people, and most people in difficult situations, may have made the best possible decision available when they faced that decision. \n\nThe manual laborer or the parent of young children with a herniated disc doesn't really have the choice to succumb to the pain. They may have to medicate to take care of their families and this may not be a temporary situation for them. They risk addiction to feed their kids and so would every other parent in their shoes. \n\nI think we do a really poor job of realizing that the individuals who make up the opioid epidemic likely live in circumstances that make this the best choice available to them. I made exactly the same choice today. There, but by the grace of god, go I. And I think that's probably true for all of us not only with regards to addiction but most difficult circumstances that affect the lives of people."

        "post": "I've been going on a lot of dates lately because I enjoy the company of other people. I've noticed there is some interest in what it is like to go on dates now among people who already knew this about me. I'm willing to have a conversation about it either here for via pm if you have questions.  Here are the answers to the questions I have already gotten. \n\n- I do not think of marriage as the only valid reason to date and recommend against that approach.\n- I think each date is good and valuable. Even if it doesn't lead to another, I've met a person, I've learned a thing, and probably had a pretty decent cup of coffee.\n- I don't divulge identifying details about people with whom I go on dates. \n- For me, going out on dates is fun even as a 36 year old person. The people I go on dates with are generally in their 20s and 30s though I don't care about how old a person is. \n- flirting via text is hard. I don't know how to emoji. One person keeps sending me three upside down question marks and I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. \n- #metoo has made dating a hell of a lot better. It's certainly different. But it's much better. \n- Dat communication tho.\n- Sometimes dates go really well. Sometimes I bomb hard. Most of the time it's fun. Even bombing is fun sometimes. Other times it's a bummer. Often people no show.\n- First dates are usually short. Second dates are usually great. I don't go on a lot of third dates.\n- I tend to use OkCupid to source people with whom to go on dates.  Options abound. I experiment with other platforms. What is good for me might not be good for you.\n- I do no think my dating experience is typical. \n- I try to decide if I want to go on a date with a person based on that person regardless of  their circumstances. \n- I'm not entirely clear with myself on my motives but it seems more capacity building than asset acquiring.\n- A lot of people I meet on OKC are in open or poly relationships. I go on dates with these people too.\n- I think location, culture, and population, make a major difference in how fun it is. In Pittsburgh, this is fun. This might not be fun in Shreveport.\n- Being my friend is better than being my date.  It certainly lasts longer. \n- I decided to go on dates again because I'm in Pittsburgh for several months so there is a chance something could go somewhere. That's not my goal but it's an exciting possibility.\n -Yes. \n\nWhile I'm on the topic, there are a number of folks I should have dated but didn't over many years. That was shitty of me. If you think you were one of those people then you might have been. Y'all deserved better than that. But if you're reading this then you're probably my friend which is indeed better than that."

Specifically, what are the things you would recommend in your neighborhood? What about places west of 49 or north of downtown."

This is probably more like when Dimitry Medvedev was president of Russia from 08-12 instead of Putin. We know where the power actually lies. But unlike the Russian scenario Castro probably will doe during Diaz-Canel's term which means he might be the leader in fact in addition to leader in title. \n\nThink about this moment in Cuban history. For the first time since the revolution they're going to have a leader who was not a Castro, not a member of the revolution, and not somebody the US has been trying to kill for 50 years. \n\nFrom a US-Cuba perspective this is an critical transition of power. Near the end Fidel Castro saw the future of Cuba as a member of the modern western. Raul Castro and Obama enacted historic policy to make this possible we reduced sanctions, opened an embassy, and allowed travel for the first time in generations. It is overwhelmingly in the best interests of the US and Cuba for us to embrace their transition. We should be friends. \n\nBut this will require significant and important statecraft. Both our history and our present are complicated. But our state department is in shambles at the highest levels. We don't have a confirmed secretary of state and we don't have a chief of mission to Cuba. We do have some career officials in between (and I'm sure they're not busy ongoing political situations elsewhere) but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to significantly change the trajectory of our relationship with our most contentious neighbor and we're going to miss it because we are unprepared an under-resourced. Cuba is knocking on our door but nobody is there to answer. \n\nBoth Chinese president Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have already personally reached out to Diaz-Canel and Raul Castro. China was ready for this. We were not.\n\nAgain, there are significant long term consequences to decimating our ability to wage peace. Gen Mattis had it right when he said \"If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately\"."

Education is maybe the most impactful institution in America. I immediately looked up Caddo because, even after all the shit I talk about Caddo, I want to believe in the future of Caddo Parish. I love the potential Caddo has and hate that we've realized so little of it. I knew what would be in this report. We all know what it's going to show us about racial disparity in Caddo Parish schools. But I still deeply saddened to see it. We gotta do better y'all. And I think Caddo probably is doing better. I believe in the progress that is being made. I'm thrilled that the white flighters are gone though I know it hurts the tax base. (People who are unwilling to have black neighbors can move to bossier, enjoy their suburban cowardice in the dustbin of history, and make space for people who believe in tomorrow. Bless their hearts.)  But Caddo has a lot of work to do. It's still affirmatively harder to succeed as a black student in Caddo than a white one and harder still for black female students.  \n\nI have to go to class now because education is important but I'll search through and see what I can glean from the data about the current state of race in Caddo schools.  (Full disclosure: today it's at a bar which may be slightly less important. But also means I can't update in class today.)  \n\nA good starting point: how equitable is punishment? \nhttps://ocrdata.ed.gov/Page?t=d&eid=26769&syk=8&pid=2539"

I wonder what became of the rest of the law school crew. \n\nThey were brilliant people. Some were smart enough to realize that a career in law was not their path to happiness and brave enough to go a different way. Others I suspect have been attorneys for ten years.  I hope they all found the way to the places they wanted to be.\n\n(for my newer friends: I didn't go to law school. I was dating Laura, the gal in the picture, at the time while she went to law school and was the ever present boyfriend who doubled as a study buddy and cross examination practice. I was adjacent to but not a part of this crew.)"

I'm proud that people still choose to immigrate to America. \n\nWhen my last ancestor arrived he came through Ellis Island as an illiterate barber. His son was a college professor. His sons son is a professor. His sons sons son is me. It is possible for a person to arrive in America with nothing and their descendants can rise to any height (or in my case descend a bit). Every American is the descendant of native people, immigrants, refugees, and slaves. This is what made America great.\n\nI know we're not living our values at this moment and we haven't for a while. I have faith that, some day, America will remember who she is and once again lift our lamp beside the golden door."

That said the people I met that night were the best part of the evening and I hung out with them for years and hope to again next time we're in the same place. \n\nThis is an example of a the state of being both really happy that this event is (probably still) great and the people I met are absolutely amazing and legitimately bummed that I haven't been back or seen these folks in years. Most of my Facebook friends are people I'm thrilled to know and hope to see again someday. Is there a word for this?\n\nIt's weird to feel joy and sorrow simultaneously but this is true for much of my life these days. I take great pleasure in recalling my past adventures and friends but always with a pang of regret that I haven't been back or followed up or kept in touch. \n\nI used to believe the answer was to just be glad that it happened and not sad that it ended but that seems clearly false a few iterations in. Perhaps the two are not separate but sides of the same coin. And I chose to pick them up and enrich my life though I know they are not exclusively good. \n\nBut I am certain that I can't let longing for past happiness prevent me from enjoying the present.  While I'm hopeful that my life meets back up with the brilliant people and places that have come before, I'm obviously not going to wait for it. On that note I'm posting this then going to play with a friend who wasn't alive when these pictures were taken."

If he lies it's almost certainly life in prison. He still faces state charges. He lost $46M which he probably does not have. And now his Ukranian and Russian friends probably want him dead (probably his family too). It made sense for him to fight, go to prison, and pray for a pardon from an outgoing president. This was a terrible option for Manafort and is affirmatively worse for having gone to trial on the prior charges. How were his other options worse?"

The GOP has had every branch of government for two years and failed to provide a viable alternative but have voted to repeal. (I liked Graham Cassidy a little but they wouldn't even vote on it)  The only reason my friends and family continue to receive necessary medical treatment is because John McCain was unwilling to force millions to go without insurance for political gain. Bill Cassidy was willing. Mike Johnson was. John Kennedy was. Pat Toomey was. I can't support any of them or anyone else in that party at a level where they would have a say on if my family, friends, and neighbors can continue to receive medical care. (makes me sad because I otherwise like Bill Cassidy and appreciate the work he did to find a better option.) But in the end only 7 republican senators and all of the democrats stood up for healthcare. Now that McCain has died the GOP has the votes to repeal. The only way my family and friends can continue to get medical care is if the Democrats take the house in November. The GOP had 8 years to come up with a plan and 2 years of complete power to pass it and the best they could do is coming one vote short of just repealing it with no replacement and just letting people suffer. For this reason I can not vote for them."

My friends in their late twenties have never known peace. \n\n100 years ago yesterday the guns in the war to end all wars feel silent and people believed in peace. I don't think young Americans believe in peace anymore. They've certainly never lived it. We now have members of Congress who have never known America at peace. \n\nWe need to give people a reason to believe that this country can exist without the horrors of war. I don't now what happens when the next generation of leadership has only ever known the US to be at war.\n\nIt saddens me that so many of my friends have never known America at peace. I sometimes try to tell them what it was like before perpetual war but I was 19 on 9/11. I remember a much better place than this one and I don't remember it well but I hope that someday we one again enjoy the silence."

I think he's the best GOP President since Eisenhower but America still bears the scars of his indifference to the suffering of people he apparently didn't think worth helping.\n\nWe ought to all thank him for a lifetime of service from joining the military at 17 after Pearl Harbor all the way to humanitarian work in his dying days. I ought to share this 3 min debate question that, I think, still could be blueprint for honest and compassionate republicans.  We should be grateful that he didn't take a victory lap when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, though it might have made him invulnerable in his 1992 election, and went to the work of seamless German re-unification instead. Think of how strong a partner Germany is for the US and how good the EU has been for global stability. GHWB absolutely deserves some credit for the strength of our strongest ally. He lost the election in 1992 to Bill Clinton and went on to support him for the good of the country. He voted for Hillary because he knew Trump was fundamentally unfit to be President. (He was the most qualified president since Eisenhower. Hillary would have been second.) I think the amount of courage he showed by remaining a public figure in his last years despite being visibly older and less able than he was in his prime is heartwarming and often overlooked. Great men used to hide away in their old age ashamed of what the years did to their bodies and abilities. Not GHWB. Once wheelchairs became his best form of mobility he started wearing interesting socks knowing that the image of him in a wheelchair didn't have to be one of a dying shell of a person but that wheelchair users - even very old ones - live vibrant lives an the imaged of him should reflect that for the nation to see. For these reasons, and many others, the good side of his scale is heavy with accomplishment. \n\nBut the other side is heavy too. He absolutely and unforgivably ignored the aids crisis. He was complicit in and lied about the Iran Contra affair. The Road of Death in Iraq (US Troops ambushed, trapped, and slaughtered retreating Iraqis) is by definition a war crime. His method of campaigning - particularly the infamously racist Willie Horton ad - has led the GOP down a dark road which has led to our current fractured state.  While polite and good to individual people he clearly didn't care about black lives during the crack epidemic, he didn't care about gay lives during the aids epidemic, he didn't care about Iranian or Nicaraguan lives during Iran Contra and he didn't care about Iraqi lives on the road of death. In many other ways he was not a man up to the task of his time. \n\nWhen both sides of the scale are so laden with deeds the entire contraption breaks. He should never be forgotten for his good deeds and never forgiven for his monstrous indifference and cruelty."

The most common world map, the Mercator projection, sacrificed relative size and positioning of the continents to create a rectangular map and north is up orientation. Near the equator the map is correct then skews badly as it gets closer to the poles. The map sacrifices being a square to keep the relative size of continents correct.

        "post": "The unexpected retirement of Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is an enormous loss for the country. He is exactly the person we need as secretary of defense.\n\n When I have more time (I'm on the road to Louisiana) I'll write more in praise of Mattis. \n\nI think everyone should read his retirement letter and understand that his resignation came after the President decided to withdraw from Syria without consulting the military and that in doing so we are abandoning the Kurds, our most reliable ally in the region, who fear they will probably be slaughtered by the Turks. \n\nHere is the letter:\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nI have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.\n\nI am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\n\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.\n\nI pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.\n\nJames N. Mattis"

Not every family can afford a visit from Santa and those kids are no less good and no less nice than kids from families that can afford a visit from Santa Claus. \n\nIt's important that we not associate goodness or niceness with wealth but for children that is exactly what the naughty vs nice list does. It creates the premise that kids who get presents are judged to be nice and kids who didn't, or got fewer, are judged to be naughty or less nice. \n\nI've talked to Santa about this last year and he's devistated that some kids, all of whom are good, believe they must be bad because he couldn't make it to their house last year.  So let's not make Santa Claus sad again this year by making sure that all kids know that Santa would give presents to every child if they could and that Santa has never put a child on the naughty list because he knows all children are good kids."

When you hire someone with that history, to some degree, you condone that history. Maybe Briles has done nothing wrong at FSU but when you lie with dogs you're going to get fleas."

Police Chief Mitch would be one of those things. Not only would he be brilliantly suited for the post but he wants Shreveport to succeed more than he wants personal success. Shreveport needs those people in the important jobs."

Officially, I'm a software developer in the Testing Center of Excellence(TCoE) in the Asset Management Group (AMG) at PNC (just PNC). Today was a paperwork day so I have a lot to learn about what exactly I'll be doing day to day but my current understanding is that my team writes programs that make sure that apps, updates, and features the AMG releases a) do what the clients expects it to b) doesn't break anything else and c) doesn't fail in predictable use cases. Hopefully, I'll know more details by the end of the week and not actually die from cubicle exposure. It's generally considered a solid to very good first programming job.\n\nyou: wait, you're a programmer now?\nme: yep.\nalso me:\n\nIn Jan 2018 I was tired of the up and down nature of oil and gas and keenly aware that my job would be automated soon and applied to Academy Pittsburgh. I got into the experimental 6 month part time night class from March to September. PNC contacted Academy looking to hire new programmers. I applied, interviewed in October and November and expected to start in January but the position went form a first quarter hire to a second quarter hire. I was out of town last week and thus started today. My route through Academy is unusual (it's traditionally 3 months full time) but the outcome isn't. There are other Academy grads working at PNC (at least one who graduated after me) as well as dozens of others working in other places around Pittsburgh.\n\n If you want in - and I highly recommend it if you're thinking about changing jobs - they're accepting applications for the next session that starts on the 29th. And due to the success Academy has enjoyed they're doubling the class size and have added a second instructor. (Jean, who amazing. John is too. As was my instructor Zach.) Because they're doubling the class size this is going to be a really good and slightly easier class to get into. They're going to start reviewing applications this week. The actual deadline is the 15th but earlier is better. It's only 3 months but it's full time 9-5ish. \n\nIf you have any questions about my new job or academy let me know. I'm glad to answer them. Really, ask me anything.\n\n(Not Pictured: a tremendous amount of side hustle)\nhttps://academypgh.com/academy-pittsburgh-rolling-application/"

We had several parents and sometimes kids came to class, we had at least one immigrant, we had an electrician, a person who did art for grocery stores, a photographer, a shoe salesman, a person who sold vintage postcards on etsy, a video editor, an engineer, a library volunteer, and a number of unemployed people who decided to make their next job more lucrative than their last one. Some of us had college degrees others hadn't been in a class since high school. My class was a bouquet of bad-asses. \n\n It is central to reason Academy exists that people who are underrepresented in tech are affirmatively enabled to join the industry. Don't feel like this isn't for you unless you're not interested or can't afford to go unpaid from 9-5 m-f for 12 weeks.Otherwise, academy is a thing you can do while broke. They will provide a laptop if you don't already have one. Your age, educational background, gender, orientation, economic status, criminal history, disability, health, family need, etc are not going to be an issue. (I didn't even have a permanent address when I applied. I had an air mattress in friends second bedroom and only bought a bed when I knew I would have to be in town for 6 months). \n\nI think would be a good opportunity for artists who aren't going to be in day time rehearsal for the next 3 months but want more lucrative side hustles. Sex workers, bar tenders, retirees,  people living in shelters, parolees, anybody who wants to get into tech should apply and they will absolutely consider you. \n\nThe decision tree should be 1) do I have an interest in programming? 2) can I afford to not get paid 9-5 m-f for 12 weeks? \n\nIf the answers were yes you should apply.\n\nNow, I don't mean to suggest Academy is easy - it's definitely not. But I am saying people who don't think of them selves as \"tech people\" can definitely do this. This was why Academy exists."

More classmates to learn from, two instructors to help students get \"unstuck\" and the larger class size means they can have an even wider pool of backgrounds in class. I know some of the students who recently got accepted into session 8 and I'm excited got them. I had the opportunity to chat up the CTO of PNC (the second highest reaming tech guy) about Academy (he asked about my programming background). He suggested that they might send me back to Academy for a day to talk up PNC and recruit. I hope it comes to pass that I can help out session 8 and I hope those of y'all who want to apply actually do. But you've got to start the application today."

This is the soccer equivalent of an NFL defense never letting the opponent cross the 50. The USWNT is probably the best team in the history of the sport. There have been 8 women's world cups and the US has won 4, lost one on penalty kicks, and has never placed lower than third. The USWNT is America at it's best and we should all be immensely proud of the athletes. But how did America get so damn good at women's soccer?\n\nThe answer is a still controversial law called Title IX which mandates that all schools that receive federal funding not discriminate in opportunity on the basis of sex including sports and athletic scholarships. Only 700 girls were playing soccer in the US in 1972 when it passed the first time (it was later gutted by the supreme court, passed again by congress, vetoed by Reagan, and overridden by congress in 1988) . Now we're the global powerhouse in women's soccer. At the last Winter Olympics the US women won more medals than the US men. Serena Williams might be the most dominant individual athlete in any sport ever. In just 2 generations US Womens Athletics has become globally dominant.  \n\nNot only should every American be proud of our Women's National Team but also take note that when we invest in girls like we do in boys those girls grow into women of immeasurable talent. Sure, it's embarrassing that we had to pass a law to give girls the same opportunities we gave boys, but we should be proud that our society eventually got over our own bias and gave girls a chance. It's a powerful thing for a culture to be able to change for the better.  I see this USWNT as living proof that American can change for the better. It  may take three acts of congress, over riding a presidential veto, and two generations but America can be better. \n\nAlso, Title IX wasn't just for sports. When it passed only 13% of doctorate degrees were awarded to women. in 2018 it was 51%. Today, we're celebrating the athletes of the US Women's National Team but we should remember women are achieving in every facet of society not just the playing field. Women and girls have effectively flipped the gender achievement gap and it's long past time that we close the gender pay gap as well."

Passed in 1793 and signed into law by George Washington the law allowed slave hunters to ignore local laws while rounding up and deporting escaped slaves back into slavery. However, freedom loving people in free states generally kept people living in their states out of the hands of slave hunters. In 1850 the law was amended to make it a crime to not help the slave hunters. Abolitionists revolted and dared the authorities to arrest them. The law was abolished during the civil war. \n\nI think every American familiar with it now realizes this was a bad law. The idea that the law would enslave people, re-enslave people, force abolitionists to re-enslave people, and override state and local laws in order to satisfy statues of chattel properties is unjust and inhumane. What the slave hunters and the politicians who passed these laws did was both legal and absolutely wrong. The abolitionists and authorities in free states who defied these laws are American heroes despite breaking American law. \n\nThe American story, from the Boston Tea Party, to the Revolutionary War, to the Underground Railroad, to the march on Montgomery is one of patriots refusing to honor unjust laws. America was born in that space between justice and legality and has been crawling towards justice for 250 years. \n\nI hope you've never wondered if you would side with British loyalists over the American revolutionaries, with slavers over freedom, or racism over justice. But the way you feel about the treatment of people escaping violence and terror by fleeing north to the land of the free is the probably the answer. \n\nIt was unjust to round up people and send them into the hell from whence they came because of some small law in 1793, in 1850, and it still is in 2019."

And there absolutely are good and welcoming churches that don't try to isolate or brainwash their parishioners. Good churches strive to help their communities live good vibrant fulfilling lives. Good churches are serious about loving their neighbors. If your church is an impediment to loving your neighbors - and especially if they tell you to reject your neighbors - then you should find a different church. \n\nThis is also true of politics. If the only place you feel accepted is with other people of your same political affiliation then you should strongly reconsider it. If it's politics and church then you should probably run as fast as you can away from them both. \n\n(I'm not especially articulate on the topic of churches and I don't mean to insult all churches or organized religion or faith in general. But I do find churches that manipulate their members to the benefit of the organization to be repugnant and heretical in every religion with which I am familiar. I fear this may be most churches.)"

One of the women died. Nobody knows why yet. There might not even be a why. There are cameras at my bus stop now. My bus is a bit late. It's wired that somebody was murdered  here a few hours ago. As I stand here I can't help but think I'm glad the person who chose violence today didn't have a gun. If they had I think we may have had many victims instead of many witnesses. I wonder if the officer is alive because a knife is not a gun. In Dayton 9 people were murdered with an assault rifle in 32 seconds this weekend. At my bus stop today only one person was murdered which I guess counts as improvement these days."

Do they feel like heroes for the lives they saved or failures for the lives they didn't? They did absolutely everything anyone could have asked of them and 9 people were still murdered. Our society set them up or failure. They were perfect in action but it didn't matter. 9 people died. It's traumatic enough that we ask police to kill people in this situation but to also have innocent people killed in mass on their watch? How could they not be haunted forever by this event despite their perfect response? \n\nThere is an amorphous line somewhere between a weapon of mass destruction - which no citizen in America may own - and a knife - which anyone in America can own. Maybe we should draw that line at any weapon designed to kill people in mass is a weapon of mass destruction. The police in Dayton failed because we asked them to do the impossible. No amount of policing can secure a society in which weapons designed for mass killing are readily and legally available. We can't keep asking the police to do the impossible."

I've never been to Kiev but an really surprised to find out I've been wrong the entire time.\n\n2) No Republicans mounted a real fact based defense it claimed Trump was innocent. Nobody said the president was innocent. There was a lot of redirection, questioning the evidences validity, and Jim Jordan made a bizarre attempt to say Trump didn't do something different from what is being impeached. But no cogent argument for actual innocence. \n\n3) I'm reminded that I would love to work for the state department. I think our career diplomats and their mission is among the most important and optimistic on Earth. If we ever live in a good world it'll be the work of diplomats. That said I can't imagine dedicating your life to so noble a goal as peaceful progress then having to work for this type of criminal."

There doesn't appear to be any historical record of it.\n2) Did any other children flee Bethlehem?\n3) Were they too poor to afford an attorney?\n4) Were Jesus granparents involved at all?\n5) Did Jesus have any other family?"

So far, I've paid for an app (swipe) that excludes all fb ads and I hide all content from any page or site or group that was shared even if I like it. Shared content dilutes from the thing I actually want: original thoughts and photos from my friends. I don't want to see that a friend reacted to a thing that was designed to manipulate them into reacting to it. Shared content from pages, sites, and groups is also how disinformation spreads.\n(I realize some people feel most comfortable existing themselves in the words of others. I'm not sure how to accommodate those folks and still have a useful news feed)\n\nI would also like to get rid of anything designed to be eye catching (backgrounds, bold text, etc). Ideally my experience here would be pain text that by friends actually typed themselves and photos my friends actually created. I'm also cool with links to things but would opt against page previews.  Does anyone know how to do any of these things?"

Unlike all of those folks I'm not privy to nor constrained by classified materials so I can share everything that I've learned.

The US claims no US deaths and 11 injuries. The Iranians claim 80 us deaths and 200 injuries. (It is unclear how many Iraqis died in the missile attack but Trump claims it's zero) More in comments:"

But if Biden Boomers and Bernie Bros and Yang Gang all work in the general for whomever the candidate is then that candidate will win in November. I kinda hate that we gotta spend 9 months on this but we do. Break time is over.\n\n(I think registering new voters in Pittsburgh is probably the best use of my time but I'll defer to the people who are actually doing the work.)"

He was the founder and CEO of Chesapeake Energy during the height of the fracking boom and was the biggest player in the Haynesville Shale until he was forced out due to financial shenanigans. He later started AEP (American Energy Partners) which also became a major energy player. This guy made and lost and made billions of dollars more than once. He was so important in the fracking boom and ensuing energy geopolitical landscape that you couldn't make a film about the boom without mentioning him. He was also my go to example of a guy who would do things which might technically legal but are probably not within the spirit of the law. Yesterday he was indicted by the department of justice for rigging the prices of auctions for oil and gas rights. He denied the charges. Today his SUV drove into an overpass at a high rate of speed killing him instantly before his Tahoe caught fire. (Cue the conspiracy theories)\n\nIt's hard for me to understand the highs and lows in a life like his. I, and basically all of my former colleagues, owe their careers (certainly the pay checks) to the Aubrey McClendons of the world. I still believe the fracking boom was and will be good for America. Although I've always considered McClendon to be ethically shady I am sad that he's died. I think he held a place in my mind similar to that of an Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller: a titan of industry, a shameless profiteer, and a devotee of the capitalist idea that what's good for business is good for America. Perhaps I've over romanticized the risk taker but McClendon was an incarnation of the American dream like an overly profitable cowboy."

        "post": "It's been a long 4 years.\n \nI still think the fracking boom was good for America but I'm less sure of it now. For me, the crux of the question down to this: Did the fracking boom set renewable energy behind by forcing down the cost of energy or did renewable need the time to become viable? Coal peaked in 2008 and the shale boom started in 2006. By the time the boom fizzled in 2016 coal production went from 1.2B tons to 736M tons. In the fight against climate change taking coal out of the energy mix and replacing it with fracked gas is a big long term win though not necessarily in the short term (methane is worse than CO2 initially but escapes the atmosphere in a decade or two  while CO2 remains for at least 1,000 years). The environmental damage to things like water supplies is less than the damage from coal mining and doesn't endanger the entire planet but is still a huge problem as are the earthquakes in heavily fracked areas that are not on fault likes like Dallas. \n\nOn a geopolitical front domestic natural gas production has 100% ended our dependency on foreign sources of energy. We may never go to war for oil again. (Well, a rational president wouldn't take us to war for oil anyway) We can also push back on oil powers like Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Norway because they no longer hold as much leverage over our economy. Also, cheaper energy prices bolster economies around the world. I'm 100% for bolstering the global economy particularly if it benefits the least developed areas. I think this is a win for fracking.\n\nGood: decreasing coal use, decreasing oil use, ending dependency on foreign sources of energy.\n\nBad: may have delayed better (greener) solutions to our energy mix, non-climate change environmental damage may prove to be significant and long lasting.\n\nAs for Aubrey McClendon, I have much less tolerance for his type of corporate shadiness. I'm hopeful that the age of the robber baron billionaires is coming to a close."

But they won't be there if they don't have customers for weeks or months. \n\nAnd let's be honest. There are lots of days when we worked in coffee shop for 6 hours bought 2 drinks and tipped $5. They are always cool with us over staying and we should return the favor even if it means over paying a bit for coffee beans. \n\n(The cold brew concentrate at Caffe D'amore is particularly fantastic if you're into cold brew)"

It was about $60/bbl when I decided to start moving out of the industry in early 2018. Today the WTI fell to -$40/bbl. \n\nThe negative price is a bit flukey. Basically, people who bought oil futures in the past that were due today had to either take delivery of 1m barrels of oil (and pay the shipping costs) or sell their right to the oil to someone who wanted to take delivery of it. But nobody has any spare storage capacity so nobody wanted to take ownership of the oil. Thus people had to pay up to $40 to someone else for them to accept delivery (and pay the shipping costs) of a million barrels of oil. There was also recently a Saudi move to over product to crush their opposition in the oil market and the caronavirus has pushed oil consumption to a previously unthinkably low level. So this was a real bad time even before the futures came due.\n\nThat said, this has never happened before and I don't think anybody knows what happens next."

If any party candidate polls at 15% or better they will be included in the presidential debates. There are only three parties whose nominees will be on all 50 ballots in November: Democrat, Republican, Libertarian. Gary Johnson, the presumptive libertarian nominee polled at 11% in the most recent poll to include him and that's significant given that nobody has ever heard of him. If you feel like your party is shoving a candidate down your throat or that a candidate has been shoved down theirs send a third up on stage with them. There is nothing the party chairs want less than for their voters to have another option. I don't think Governor Johnson is even close to an ideal candidate but he would be the only person at the debates who thinks bombing the hell out of people is wrong. I think we need that view in our presidential debates and we need to remind the two main parties that we have other options for President and will not blindly vote for the D or R. \n\nThere are probably better candidates for President but the only one who is even close to the 15% threshold is Gary Johnson. So if you were in the #neverTrump camp or the Hillary version, consider voting for Gary Johnson. It'll get our point across."

These are psychologically hard times for everyone and people are going to react differently. These people are probably just afraid and incapable of accepting what's happening around them. They're also the subjects of a well funded propaganda campaign to drive their perfectly reasonable fear to this absurd political end. \n\nI think the people in the pictures want the outcomes of not being afraid and feeling powerful or being able to protect and provide for the people they care about. I assume they brought their guns to get news coverage and in a petty attempt at intimidation. But they bought those guns because they believe, or want to believe, that the threat to the people and things they care about is othered people. \n\nAnd now they don't know what to do. The fact that other people are what's saving them from the threat to everything they care about is probably too discordant to believe. They expected this to be a shooting time not a staying time.\n\nSo they're at home with nothing to do but be afraid and listen to lies about how none of this is real and they can act and end this if they just do what the propaganda tells them to. What we're seeing in those pictures is trauma. Those folks need counseling. \n\n(I still obviously think anyone who brings a firearm into a government building should forefit the weapon and go to jail (or house arrest until jail is safe) and that includes these folks because they are clearly a threat to human life.)"

But that's who responds when there is a call about a homeless person. Why not send an EMT instead? Or better yet a trained social worker who actually knows how to help homeless people? But because we send police the result is often homeless people being incarcerated or murdered by police. \n\nWe shouldn't be playing for police and prisons to deal with addiction and drug use. Send an EMT, a social worker, a rehab specialist? You don't need a badge and a gun. You need narcan, empathy, training, and real options to help. But because we send police the result is too often incarceration or murder by police \n\nWe shouldn't be paying police to respond to a person  mental health crisis. Again send a social worker who actually knows how to help a person on crises. But because we send police the result is too often incarceration and murder by police.\n\nWe shouldn't be sending police to respond to car wrecks. We can send an EMT and a legal observer to do gather evidence and collect statements.\n\nOnly 5% of what we send police to do is violent crime and that's the only time a badge and gun are useful. 95% of what we're paying police to do would be better done by someone else. Someone who is actually capable of helping and incapable of state sanctioned murder.\n\nWe're ask the police to do too much and have set them up for failure. And when those failures include murder we have to start over. We have rebuild something better."

They court ruled that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 which systemically denies immigrants what we consider due process is constitutional. (Obviously, we need to repeal this law as part of comprehensive immigration reform)"

We can also celebrate an whole freedom season from Juneteenth to July 4th. I know in many neighborhoods people have been shooting fireworks since at least Juneteenth presumably in celebration."

I went to a vigil in Shreveport to honor the people murdered by police where we also honored those 5 officers because they too are victims of bad cops. 10 days after the Dallas shooting an Iraq war veteran murdered 3 police officers in Baton Rouge. \n\nThe 8 officers murdered in two attacks died because of bad cops. \n\nIt's been 4 years and bad cops are still endangering good cops. The departments, unions, and cities who should be protecting good cops have failed to address the reason those 8 officers never came home to their families and that's why we need to abolish qualified immunity then defund, and in some cases disband, the police. . \n\nWe can not continue to risk the lives of our neighbors and the lives of all cops just because fixing the problem is hard. \n\nSaying their names:\nAlton Sterling \nSenior Cpl.

I went once/week (I was only in Erie 1/week) and it cost $50/month for the privileged. You can also do a day pass for $15.\n\nMy office has been shut down since March and it felt great to spend some time in casual but professional atmosphere away from the house.  \n\nI highly recommend Radius particularly now that we're all working from home."

It's also worth noting that the candidacy of Andrew Yang gained more traction that anyone expected running on a similar idea that automation is going to reconsider our economic system and proposed a universal basic income so people can do what they think is valuable rather than what some corporation thinks is valuable.\n\nAs for me, I no longer work in the industry I considered doomed when posting this and I think I only know one person who still is, or was before covid.

The GOP has had every branch of government for two years and failed to provide a viable alternative but have voted to repeal. (I liked Graham Cassidy a little but they wouldn't even vote on it)  The only reason my friends and family continue to receive necessary medical treatment is because John McCain was unwilling to force millions to go without insurance for political gain. Bill Cassidy was willing. Mike Johnson was. John Kennedy was. Pat Toomey was. I can't support any of them or anyone else in that party at a level where they would have a say on if my family, friends, and neighbors can continue to receive medical care. (makes me sad because I otherwise like Bill Cassidy and appreciate the work he did to find a better option.) But in the end only 7 republican senators and all of the democrats stood up for healthcare. Now that McCain has died the GOP has the votes to repeal. The only way my family and friends can continue to get medical care is if the Democrats take the house in November. The GOP had 8 years to come up with a plan and 2 years of complete power to pass it and the best they could do is coming one vote short of just repealing it with no replacement and just letting people suffer. For this reason I can not vote for them."

Healthcare and covid-19 are the most important things happening during his term and he's accomplished nothing. I really think Louisiana would be better served if he just came back and picked up his medical practice and actually helped actual people rather than just been a party line vote in the Senate. Any idiot can vote how their told. Bill Cassidy could have done more and didn't. Someday, I hope to know what happened to him."

As a result McConnell may obstruct everything for 2 years and the gop may gerrymander districts for another decade. That's a big loss. Biden and the democrats were unwilling to put the wellness of their supporters and their staff at risk for political gain and it cost them.\n\nThen I see articles like this I realize there Democrats made the right choice. I don't want politicians who want power more than they want the well-being of the country. \n\nI hope all of these secret service agents are getting the same quality care that the president got. And I hope the hundreds of people whose infections are linked to Trump rallies survive. And I hope future politicians will put the good of the people they serve over their own lust for power.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/11/13/610eebcc-2539-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html"

Not every family can afford a visit from Santa and those kids are no less good and no less nice than kids from families that can afford a visit from Santa Claus. \n\nIt's important that we not associate goodness or niceness with wealth but for children that is exactly what the naughty vs nice list does. It creates the premise that kids who get presents are judged to be nice and kids who didn't, or got fewer, are judged to be naughty or less nice. \n\nI've talked to Santa about this last year and he's devistated that some kids, all of whom are good, believe they must be bad because he couldn't make it to their house last year.  So let's not make Santa Claus sad again this year by making sure that all kids know that Santa would give presents to every child if they could and that Santa has never put a child on the naughty list because he knows all children are good kids."

Or at least I tend to post about being lost in cold places on January 11ths.\n\nIn addition to the photo of me from 3 years ago being lost in the arctic fog of what I thought was Norway but was actually Finland (properly Lapland), I was also a different sort of lost a decade ago outside a Holiday Inn Express in Douglas, Wyoming. There were no photos of this wrong-place-ness but I wrote a short note about it which will be in the comments.\n\nOn this January 11th I'm lost again in yet another way. (So is the cold actually, I was outside barefoot in Pittsburgh - having learned no lessons from Wyoming - and it was snowing in Shreveport.) It's a strange lost-ness as my body is in the same place it's been for what feels like a year but isn't quite. I've been in my place (properly my girlfriends place) and I don't know when we'll be able to be in the others places and sometimes I'm not even sure if we're going the right way. I'm pretty comfortable with being lost (we're old friends) but this it feels like we're all lost in long shadows hoping if we walk their path we'll find the light that cast them. \n\nI'm good at being lost but I'm also stuck (stuck and I go way back too). Worse than stuck, I'm stuck far from my people. Even my people in Pittsburgh seem very far. The few other places I've been in lately are also all wrong. I was in a hurricane dodging bachelor party, an outdoor wedding under blue skies and clouds so heavy I'd have preferred a hurricane, a funeral, and soon a wake. While I don't begrudge my friends moving on into marital bliss funerals are strictly verboten. My friends are not supposed to die. And it's all too domestic and too careful besides. Though I feel very stuck the world is hauling consequential un-ignorable ass. And it too is all wrong. \n\nI don't really know where we are. I don't know if we're going the right way. The nation is in turmoil. The world has banned travel. I'm far from my people. My friend has died. In my lifetime of experience being lost and stuck I can say one thing with certainty: if we don't give up, we'll get there. Most of us anyway."

The coding boot camp I went to is holding it's next session fully remote so anyone anywhere can apply and learn to become a professional software developer.\n\n If you're out of work this is a great chance to switch to a more lucrative career that is going to be around for a long while. \n\nSoftware development is a really good gig. The average first job for academy grads pays $55k. Experienced developers make considerably more. (The average in Pittsburgh is $94k for experienced developers.) \n\nThe session starts 2/22 and ends on 5/14. It's full time and you only have to pay for it if you get a job ave earn more than $45k.\n\nhttps://www.academypgh.com/\n\nFeel free to share this with anyone who might be looking for their next thing."

I'd like to see people before then if that's responsibly possible. \n\nIs there some agreed upon best practice for get togethers when some folks are fully vaxed - and thus theoretically immune(ish) - and other folks are not but choose to take whatever risks may exist for their own person?

I highly recommend it as a safe way to learn something outdoors. \n\nWe spent hundreds of dollars and drove to Erie every Wednesday for months. But, if you live in Pittsburgh, there is a much closer and cheaper option: The Moraine Sailing Club at Lake Arthur. \n\nThe way that works is they have 10 Learn to Sail Saturdays where you spend 6 hours (3 learning, 3 sailing). You can learn to sail both a Sunfish and a Flying Scot (tiny but fun boats). Attend however many sessions you need or want to. (according to the club most people are competent sailors after 3-5 sessions)\n\nIt costs $240 ($75 membership + $165 course) which isn't cheap but is much cheaper than Erie was. (It's a little cheaper for couple/families/etc and Erie was large boats not small boats.)\n\nIf you decide that sailing is super fun you can buy access to all the club owned boats (Sunfish, Flying Scots, and Hobie Cats) for another $200 and can take them out whenever you want during the season.\n\nI haven't taken the Moraine Sailing Club sailing lessons and can't vouch for their quality but I think sailing is a fun outdoor hobby and this is a relatively accessible way to get into it.  \n\nhttp://morainesailingclub.org/asp/net/new/Learn_To_Sail.aspx"

Al Queda is functionally destroyed and Osama Bin Laden was captured. America, and the world, is safer for Bin Laden being gone. It's been nearly 20 years since the last significant foreign terrorist attach on US soil. Even if you came to the mission after Bin Laden was captured this success is your success. \n\nThank you for educating and empowering a generation of Afghan women. A generation of educated women will benefit the Afghan people and Afghan families for at least one lifetime. That would not have happened without the service men and women keeping the fighting away form the classrooms.\n\nThank you for giving the Afghan government a chance. They had 20 years to figure out how to govern their own country. They had 20 years of training and funding by the best warfighters in the world to build a functional military and police force. That it wasn't enough is not a failure of the men and women who served there. It was a failure of diplomacy and of the Afghan government to figure out their future. Your service gave them ample time to do so. \n\nI know for many veterans every day is a hard day and these days may be especially difficult. If you're struggling, or know someone who is, know you didn't serve alone and you don't need to struggle alone. \n\nAgain, thank you for all that you've done in service to our country and for keeping us safe from foreign terrorism for the last twenty years. \n\nhttps://www.veteranscrisisline.net/"

And only 1.5 years older than the Junior Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.\n\n6) The Senator he replaced in the Senate, George Aiken, was born in 1892. \n\n7) In the entire history of Vermont he's the only democrat ever elected to the US Senate. Other fun parties who have only had one senator from Vermont: Anti-Jacksonian, Anti-Administration (Jeffersonian),  Free Soil, Democratic-Republican, Independent.

Kat drove in and took me to Rooster and Owl, a Michelin star restaurant, which was a new and pretty great experience.  (a Michelin Star is among the highest awards a restaurant can earn and in this case we were served 15ish reasonably sized but unreasonably delicious dishes to be shared.) Then on Friday we went to a Wynton Marsalis concert in Reading, PA. \n\nI still haven't figured how how, or when, to celebrate with friends. I don't actually care about celebrating being one year closer to death but I am shamelessly willing to use any excuse to get my friends together. Hopefully I'll figure that out."

It's not great. But it is good.\n\n[note to non-American friends: medical debt is worse than you are imagining and credit reporting is exactly the dystopia it sounds like. The overlap between the two is the hellscape reality in which a person becomes injured or ill they often incur tremendous amounts of medial debt. (For the insured this maxes out at $17,400/year (Thanks Obama Care!). For the uninsured there is literally no limit and for serious situations the bills are regularly in the $100,000-$300,000 range/year. If you have a condition that needs ongoing treatment the amounts reset every year thus the debt grows every year.) When they patient can't pay the debt it is sold to a collection agency, whose job is to force the patient to pay the debt, and reported to the 3 credit reporting agencies who catalogue and score every Americans credit worthiness. The credit reporting agencies provide this information to lenders, employers, and anyone else who buys your credit report so they can charge the person more fees, higher rates, or simply deny them a financing or employment altogether. Each negative on a credit report stays for 7 years after the debt is paid or forever if the debt is not discharged. So if you are ill or injured in the United States and do not have excellent private insurance then you will also likely become bankrupt as a result. Making things worse - yes there is a worse - you can go to prison, denied government services, or denied freedom of movement depending on the kind of debt owned. And worse still - there is literally no bottom to this inferno - 16% of suicides in the US are related to finances. Descending further, the first sentence I found when googling that statistic was \"death does not abate a bankruptcy proceeding once begun\". In even deeper hells we can discuss what a collection agency but I have to go to work and earn my insurance now.]"

Usually public health crises affect marginalized people more than white people but not this one. I'd love to know why. Is it that poor white people are poorer than ever and this is just poverty in disguise? I suspect it has something to do with my next observation.\n3) The most dangerous guns to a minor, with the possible exception of black boys, are by far the guns in their own homes. About 1/3 of the firearm deaths of children are suicides and accidents (it's mostly suicide). \n\nI don't know what portion of children who die by gun live in a gun owning home but I suspect it's more than half. It might be more than 75%. I think owning a gun is much more likely to lead to the death of a child in that home than not owning a gun"

They have 13 cases remaining.  Here are the ones generally considered major:\n\nDobbs - This is  the case where the leaked draft overturned Roe v Wade.\n\nWest Virginia - This case will decide if the federal government can regulate carbon emissions from coal plants but may go as far as to end the EPA altogether.\n\nBiden V Texas - Biden over turned Trump era rules that any immigrant who enters from Mexico can be deported back to Mexico even if they're not Mexican and that any immigrant who uses public services (midicare, foodstamps, etc) will not be eligible for citizenship.\n\nNew York Rifle - the narrow question is if NY can require that people have a need to own and carry a handgun as part of their concealed carry laws.

The majority ruled that because the coach engaged in a quiet personal prayer while off duty he shouldn't have been fired. The dissent includes pictures and noted the obvious facts  that the coach was not off duty and was not engaged in prayer that was either quiet or personal and thus not constitutionally protected. \n\nThat lying bothers me much more than the actual ruling. Of course teachers have the 1st amendment right to engage in quiet personal prayer while off duty. That was never in dispute and had those been the facts in this case there is no way the Supreme Court would have gotten involved. But the facts in this case were not contested and were not conducive to the majority ruling as they wanted to so they just changed the facts. This seems really bad. \n\nNote: the supreme court doesn't rule on the facts of cases but rather the proper application of law to the facts which are determined in lower courts. \n\nPictured: the prayers in question. \nNot pictured: quiet personal prayers while off duty"

The CIA claims to have been using this ordinance since 2019 but the people on the receiving end claim it's been in use since 2017.

Former president Lula da Silva defeated current president Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff election. The reason that election is so important is because the Amazon rainforest is located in Brazil, can (could?) absorb 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, and was being burned down under president Bolsonaro to the point where the rainforest was(is) emitting more carbon due to the fires and deforestation than it was capturing. \n\nMost of the deforestation under Bolsonaro was technically illegal but promoted by Bolsonaro who prevented the enforcement of relevant laws. In addition to the cliamate ramifications this illegal logging and burning also created clashed between the loggers/ranchers (Much of the burned rainforest was intended to be used as cattle ranches for beef export) and indigenous people living in the Amazon. These clashes often resulted in the un punished murder of the indigenous population. The amazon is(was?) also the most biodiverse place on earth and some of the biodiversity loss to logging and burning will never return.\n\nThe election of Bolsonaro had consequences that will never be repaired. The election of Lula da Silva will likely slow then stop the damage but he can't undo the destruction of a 10 million year old rainforest in a 4 year term. \n\nReal progress is slow. Real damage is fast. Climate scientists were treating this election as an extencial crisis for the future of human life on this planet. Lula won 50.9% to 49.1% for Bolsonaro (who has not yet conceded). \n\nElections have consequences.\n\nOn the graphic: The yellow part of this graph represents the previous two terms of Lula da Silva during which the rate of deforestation dropped dramatically. The orange section shows the one term of Jair Bolsonaro during which the rate dramatically increased. For some scale you could fit the entire country of Belgium or commonwealth of Massachusetts  in the area deforested under Bolsonaro (in orange). Scientists expect/hope that da Silva will be able to reduce deforestation by 89% if he can enact his proposed policies."

No surprise judge races, city officials, etc. I was out in 5 bubbles and I already knew how I would vote on all 5. \n\nJoy: I was able to vote for a diversity of political thought and backgrounds that I think would represent and serve my community and me very well. \n\nOne major state wide candidate is center-right: They support more policing, cutting the corporate tax rate 60%, pardons for minor possession of pot, unions, raising the minimum wage,  and election reform while opposing mask/vaccine mandates,  abortion restrictions, and the death penalty.\n\nAnother major state wide candidate is center-left. They're pro policing, pro-pot legalization, pro union, pro wealth tax, pro $15/hr minimum wage, pro universal healthcare, and anti war.\n\nA district wide candidate that covers Pittsburgh is a squad level leftist. They're a democratic socialist (like Bernie Sanders) who supports the green new deal, medicare for all, police reform, ending mass incarceration, free college, a pathwy to citizenship, reproductive rights, and supreme court expansion.\n\nThose three candidates encapsulate their constituents well. Pennsylvania is a centrist swing state while Pittsburgh is a liberal city. I was glad to vote for all of these candidates and feel I would be well represented by the diverse political thought this set. \n\nGripe: There wasn't a real honest choice to make in any of these three elections. The democratic primary voters gave us those three candidates and their diverse positions. The gop primary voters gave us nothing of any value. They nominated a Jan 6th rioter for governor, a guy who has never lived in PA for senate, and a for the house race they nominated a person whose only qualification is that they have the same name as the retiring democrat incumbent. Pennsylvanians aren't stupid and I wish the GOP would respect us enough to put forward serious candidates. All 3 of these people I voted for have good relevant political experience. The only republican who has any political qualification at all is the anti election one. Do better GOP."

(In 2018 Pelosi had promised she would step down after this election to make space for the next generation of leaders and she kept her word.)\n\nShe's been such an effective speaker for so long I think people don't realize how effective and important this leadership team was. Pelosi has been the top House democrat for 20 years. In that time the GOP has gone from Dick Gephardt, to John Boehner, to Paul Ryan, to Kevin McCarthy. It's incredible she's held the democrat house together for so long. She was also the first female speaker of the house and she's been so good so long we don't even realize how much of an outlier she is. \n\nLegislation is messy but her record of accomplishment during her 20 years as democrat leader is the most impressive of anyone in this era. \n\nAnd she's not quite done yet. She's got until January when her current term ends.\n\nThere is a reason her opponents hated her so much."

        "post": "CW: Economic and physical violence\n\nI often think about the economic violence so many people suffer from every day. Lately, I've noticed that spilling over into physical violence. Almost all physical violence can find roots in economic violence. In the past few weeks a team lead at Walmart gunned down many of his direct reports. That came off the heels of a taco bell manager shooting and killing one of his direct reports. \n\nMy first \"real\" job after college was managing people earning sub-living wages in a busy restaurant. Everything about that job sucks. I was making $16-17/hr and my reports were making $5.15-6/hr. There is something perverse the greed that causes a  wealthy person to threaten economic violence against a subsistence wage earner unless they commit economic violence against economically desperate sub-living wage earners. It was untenable then and now I suspect it's much worse.  \n\nBreaking desperate people for the extraction of profit isn't a business model. It's an exploitation engine. Physical violence is a predictable outcome of human exploitation. The corporations that exploit human desperation should be held accountable for this violence.\n\n(full disclosure: I happened to be in the aforementioned taco bell when the argument occurred -the shooting happened outside- so it may be more on my mind than the greater societal facts warrant.)"

The driver of this dramatic improvement was the expanded child tax credit (from 2k to 3.6k/child). The two downsides are that even now there are still 3m American children living in poverty and that congress failed to renew the extended child tax credit thus it seems likely that in the forthcoming years much of this progress will be reversed and those 2.9m children will be plunged back into poverty. On the plus side it seems we now have a tool that works to alleviate poverty in children. Hopefully we'll have the sense to use it until the problem is solved.\n\n2) Controlled Nuclear Fusion works. Researchers at a US National Laboratory were able to create a nuclear fusion reaction that produced more energy than it consumes.Prior to this week it was uncertain that this was even possible. Nuclear fusion is how the sun creates power. It's commonly referred to as \"a star in a box\". Fusion bombs have existed for decades but are so powerful and terrible that they've never been used. It now appears likely that we can harness this power for something other than destruction. The downside is that we're still decades away from commercial fusion reactors being in use to power our homes. The plus side is that this is a nearly zero emission and nearly zero waste power source that absolutely dwarfs every other power source humanity has ever used. Technically it's not renewable energy but the fuel is water (hydrogen in the h20) and we have enough to power all of earth for billions of years. \n\nSometimes the US Federal Government does amazing things that can build a better future for all of humanity. We should absolutely celebrate these achievements. Unfortunately Congress also sometimes lifts 2.9m children out of poverty then plunges them back into poverty into poverty because of their own disfunction. A better future can exist if we insist on having it."

But my favorite bit of Jimmy Carter service is his work to eradicate Guinea Worm Disease. In 1986 3.5m people suffered - quite badly - from the parasite. In 2022 there were 12 cases. President Carter and the Carter Center are 12 cases away from only the second eradicated disease in human history. Unlike the smallpox eradication this has been done without vaccinations. \n\nI absolutely love that further peanut farmer Jimmy Carter for decades and well into his 90s has been working to eradicate this parasite that nobody in the west has ever heard of. Nobody is profiting from vaccines or medications (there are no effective medicines) and there is no fame in it. He's just doing the thankless work that needed to be done and that he was uniquely well positioned to do. \n\nI'm going to be sad when he's gone."

        "post": "\"Gold is the corpse of value\" -\nNeal Stephenson, Cryptonomicon\n\nThis seems over simplified but basically right.\n\n(This post is a disaster of me trying to organize thoughts but you're welcome to stare at this incoming train wreck)\n\nI'm trying to work out at which point a store of value becomes a corpse of value. But I haven't quite aligned it all in my mind. \n\nI'm using Value to mean something of use rather than a representation of value like currency. Saving a kid from drowning is extremely Valuable though not fungible and you can't trade it. You can trade gold but it's comparatively useless beyond its ability to facilitate trade. \n\nIron, for instance, is a much more Valuable metal than gold. It's abundant, it's strong (or can easily be made strong), it's holding up our buildings, basically everyone uses iron basically everyday. Iron adds Value to society. It's improving lives all day every day all over the world. \n\n(Is there a better word for value to society vs monetary value? I suspect some folks would rather not recognize the difference. I'll use big V Value for social good and little v value for tokens of exchange)\n\nThe value store aspect of gold is based on scarcity and peoples willingness to accept it in trade. Being scarce is a negative not a positive.  (Scarcity is outdated but that's another topic altogether.) \n\nI think of cryptocurrency, as it's currently operating,(a term coined in the same novel as this quote) is basically a negative Value store. It burns extremely useful energy to create a scarce object (crypto coin) which has no use beyond facilitating trade. It represents only the destruction of Value.  If gold is the corpse of Value, crypto is a bounty payment for the killing of Value.\n\nWhich leads to an interesting question: is excess wealth of any kind a corpse of Value? I tend think it is. In theory, wealth is the residual effect of the creation of societal Value. But reality disproves that theory. Wealth is an accumulation of little v value not societal Value. Teachers create an enormous amount of Value but rarely accumulate enough value to have excess wealth. Crypto miners create almost no Value but do, or did, accumulate enough value to create excess wealth. \n\nWhile excess wealth is to social Value as lemon lacroix is to the juice of a lemon, being unrelated to Value is not the same as being a corpse of Value. Maybe there was a time when excess wealth was built by providing societal Value but it would have been more than a lifetime ago and inherited wealth no longer the result of Value. However, excess wealth may prevent the creation of Value in the name of value. So maybe excess wealth is the castration of Value? I'm not sure if there is enough Value in excess wealth to make a proper corpse of it. \n\nThe degree to which our tokens of trade are unrelated to the creation of societal Value is a bit troubling. \n\nI obviously need to think on this more and would appreciate any insight y'all may have."
